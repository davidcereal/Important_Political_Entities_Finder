       "  'text': 'For the first time in six years, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization announced that it would expand its membership, inviting Montenegro to join the alliance. Only 16 years ago, NATO was bombing the small western Balkan nation as part of its intervention in Kosovo.With a standing military of only 2,000, Montenegro\\'s membership will have little impact on the alliance\\'s military strength. But the move has profound political consequences. It illustrates the progress that the western Balkans, and Montenegro in particular, have made since the bloody and traumatizing wars of the 1990s. To receive the invitation, Montenegro had to undertake a series of political, legal, and military reforms under the auspices of NATO\\'s Membership Action Plan, a program that offers assistance and support for countries seeking to join the alliance. That a newly independent country could reach these standards in such a short time frame speaks to the enduring and powerful draw of the Euro-Atlantic community. In that sense, this remarkable success story comes at an opportune time--it is a bright spot in Europe\\'s otherwise dark political terrain of internal strain, the refugee crisis, and the war in Ukraine.  Hazir Reka / ReutersProtesters flee from tear gas in the center of Kosovo\\'s capital Pristina, November 18, 2015. Police and protesters clashed in Kosovo for a second day on Wednesday in a deepening crisis over relations with former ruler Serbia.Montenegro\\'s membership also represents a major step toward consolidating political stability and democracy in the western Balkans; the reforms it undertook to reach this point include strengthening its governing structures and democratic institutions, as well as bringing its military up to NATO standards. NATO membership would also turn Montenegro into a regional leader and an example of how a small country, not even a decade old, can make great strides so long as it has enough political ambition. The move could inspire others, such as Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, to reenergize necessary reforms for eventual membership, a process that has stagnated in both countries. Montenegro\\'s invitation would also send a signal to Georgia and Ukraine that NATO is, in fact, honoring its \"open door policy,\" which was questioned in the face of Russia\\'s annexation of Crimea.Russia is staunchly opposed to NATO expansion due to its deep-seated and historical fear of being \"encircled\" by a potential adversary. Within Russia, President Vladimir Putin inflates the threat of NATO as the country\\'s top geopolitical foe in order to stoke Cold War-era tensions and consolidate domestic power. This makes curbing NATO expansion a strategic priority for Russia. Unsurprisingly, Russia quickly denounced NATO\\'s invitation to Montenegro, which gained independence from Russia\\'s natural ally in the region, Serbia, only nine years ago. Russia\\'s Foreign Ministry called the decision \"an openly confrontational step fraught with additional destabilizing consequences for the system of Euro-Atlantic security\" and Dmitry Peskov, President Vladimir Putin\\'s spokesman, said that NATO\\'s expansion \"cannot but result in retaliatory actions ... from the Russian side.\"Such warnings are likely rhetorical. Montenegro is more geographically insulated from Russia than Georgia or Ukraine. It\\'s more likely that Russia will retaliate through political or economic channels instead. Already, pro-Russian groups in Montenegro have taken to the streets to protest against NATO membership and have also called for the resignation of Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic. Russia may stoke further civil unrest in order to make the country appear too unstable to join NATO. That may not be difficult to do. Domestically, Montenegro faces anti-NATO factions including from within both the Orthodox Church and political parties that emphasize ties to Serbia and Russia over NATO.Russia also has substantial economic leverage over the country, particularly in the tourism and real estate industries (an estimated 40 percent of Montenegrin real estate is Russian-owned); thus, Moscow, which placed a food embargo on Montenegro after it sided with the West on Ukraine, could slap on more sanctions in order to further punish the country for its Western-leaning political ambitions.  Marko Djurica / ReutersKosovo Serb boys stand on the street during a protest, October 17, 2011.Domestically, Montenegro\\'s public is skeptical that NATO membership will be economically beneficial and is wary of the current government\\'s motives, since Djukanovic, the very man who has steered his country toward NATO inclusion, has been charged with financial corruption. An investigation by the BBC in 2012 found that he and his associates were using a partially public-funded bank for their own personal use.When the 28 NATO members vote on Montenegro\\'s membership in the coming year, Russia can fund anti-NATO political parties in countries more susceptible to Russian money, such as Hungary, Greece, or the Czech Republic, to vote, \"no.\" In the past, NATO members\\' parliaments have always deferred to their government\\'s decision on NATO enlargement, but since the decision requires unanimous consensus among all 28 members, Russian influence remains a risk. The most likely scenario, however, is that Russia will look to prevent Serbia from following Montenegro\\'s path. In recent years, Russia has worked to consolidate influence in Serbia and Republika Srpska, the ethnically Serb entity in Bosnia and Herzegovina, through economic aid and military cooperation.The EU opened accession talks with Serbia in the wake of the announcement about Montenegro\\'s NATO membership. This demonstrated a rare example of coordination between NATO and the EU, two institutions that struggle to work together because of political divisions between two of its members, Turkey and Cyprus. But this move also opens new avenues for Russia to derail progress in the Balkans, either through Serbia\\'s EU accession talks or through the fragile Serbia-Kosovo peace deal that the EU brokered in 2013.Crises in the Middle East and Ukraine have pushed the Balkans down on the priority list for many transatlantic leaders. But it is time to pay attention to the region again. Its relative calm and peace should not be taken for granted. Economic distress and the refugee and migrant crisis have stretched the Balkans\\' fledgling democracies to their limits and opened new avenues for Russian interference. Bosnia risks backsliding into political turmoil, and Macedonia\\'s ambitious political and democratic reforms suffered a monumental setback this summer after a scandal over the government\\'s wiretaps of opposition leaders and ethnic violence in the Kumanovo region. Even the watershed Serbia-Kosovo peace deal hangs by a thread today; Kosovo erupted in protests last month after the government made a deal with Serbia to integrate Serb-majority regions in Kosovo--a move supported by Brussels. These are manifestations of deep-seated and unresolved political, ethnic, and economic stresses that are bubbling beneath the surface of ostensible progress toward European integration. That is why Montenegro\\'s NATO membership invitation, although a major milestone, does not mean that peace in the region is a foregone conclusion. ',\n",

       "  'text': 'In Turkey, where there has been a rise in Islamic religiosity, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, founder of the pro-Islamist Development and Justice Party (AKP), is converting some public schools into seminaries called imam-hatips (or traditional training schools for Sunni Muslim clergy) in an effort to raise a generation of \"religious youth.\"Students who perform poorly on entrance exams for secondary school are shunted into imam-hatips where they study the Koran for up to 13 hours a week and take courses on the life of the Prophet Muhammad and Arabic. Erdogan has boasted that during his tenure as president, enrollment in these schools soared from 63,000 to over one million. The number of imam-hatips increased by 73 percent between 2010 and 2014 and 13percent of Turkish students now study at such schools.Outraged, dozens of Turkish parents in Istanbul created an advocacy group called HandsOff My School to fight against Erdogan\\'s education policy. In June of 2014, when the government tried to convert the local middle school to an imam-hatip, the group circulated a petition that quickly collected 13,000 signatures from other parents. A young lawyer from the neighborhood, Yasemin Zeytinoglu, even filed an emergency suspension with the Istanbul Administrative Court to halt the conversion.  Government officials eventually dropped the order to convert the school, giving the parents a short-lived victory. But the school stopped taking new students and after the current classes graduate, it will reopen as an extracurricular center. Left with no choice but to enroll their children in a different middle school, some parents told us that they felt the government was punishing them for protesting.In September, at the start of the 2014 school year, the members of Hands Off learned that 40,000 children were registered at imam-hatips without parental permission, including the grandson of Turkey\\'s Chief Rabbi, Ishak Haleva. Hands Off, along with the tens of thousands of people from the secular teachers\\' union and from religious minority groups, rallied forcefully in response. During one nationwide demonstration in February, the government responded by locking students inside their schools and calling the police to fire water cannons on protestors.In Gongoren, a working class borough of Istanbul where three middle schools were recently converted to imam-hatips, 50 men and women met over the summer with Zeytinoglu. She told her audience, \"The decision to change the school wasn\\'t legal. You were never asked if you wanted it to change.\" Zeytinoglu has five cases in front of the court now, each for a different school. She argued that in Gongoren, officials did not adequately consult parents and gave no notice before converting the school. Further, there was insufficient demand for religious education in the neighborhood given that it already had seven other imam-hatips.One parent, Gulay Kacar, a stout woman who wore a paisley headscarf, has a son in the fifth grade at Mehmet Akif Middle School, now an imam-hatip. To avoid religious education, which she said will deprive her son of science classes, she will have to send him to a school in another neighborhood where, \"there is so much violence, people are stabbing each other.\" She told the parents, \"They put pressure on us. They force our kids to have the education that they want.\"Kacar, along with Nurcan Aybalik, whose child was also a student at the now-converted school, set up a signature drive in the Kale Outlet Mall in the city center. Shortly after, five clean-shaven youths approached them and swore at the two women, telling them that they had loosened their headscarves and had made prostitutes of themselves by questioning Islam. \"Islam is coming and we will make you observe our laws,\" they said, according to both Kacar and Aybalik.  Umit Bektas / ReutersStudents of an Imam Hatip high school march during a Republic Day ceremony in Ankara, Turkey, October 29, 2015.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-x90_2\");    });  Extremist views are on the rise in Turkey. Twenty percent of Turks support responding to an insult against Islam with violence, up almost 8 percent from last year, according to the Turkish polling firm Metropoll. A Pew Research Center poll released last month reported that eight percent of Turkish people have a favorable opinion of ISIS and 19 percent are \"undecided.\"\"Because of the mindset of religious education, we are being polarized,\" said Aybalik. Erdogan and the AKP have fought hard to hold onto their tenuous majority in parliament, and religious values are a cornerstone of their message to their Sunni Muslim base. Meanwhile, political opponents warn that religious educational policies will polarize the citizenry. Minority groups, especially Alevi-Muslims, who follow a blend of Shia and syncretic beliefs and make up as much as 25 percent of the Turkish population, are increasingly alienated.In 2011, three Alevi Turkish parents of secondary school students brought a complaint before the European Court of Human Rights, stating that their children were forced to attend Sunni Islamic classes, in violation of the first protocol of the Convention on Human Rights Protocol: the right to education. In February of this year, the court made a final ruling, determining that Turkey\\'s compulsory religious education violates children\\'s rights. Turkey\\'s own highest court ruled similarly in June, deeming the AKP\\'s policies unconstitutional. The government has ignored these rulings. Some fear that the European Union, which recently pledged $3.2 billion in Syrian refugee aid to Turkey--in return for helping staunch the flow of migrants into Europe--may in the future turn a blind eye to such human rights abuses in Turkey.  Murad Sezer / ReutersTurkish girls read books at the library at the Kazim Karabekir Girls\\' Imam-Hatip School in Istanbul, February 10, 2010.As for claims that these religious schools breed extremism, Turkey\\'s religious leaders have countered that their Sunni education has nothing to do with radical Islam. \"Islam is a religion of peace and we teach this,\" said Huseyin Korkut, the head of Onder, an umbrella organization for imam-hatip alumni. \"Among the graduates [of imam-hatips] almost no one joined Al Qaeda or ISIS.\" Indeed, many graduates become public servants.  However, radicalism is a growing problem in Turkey. More than 1,000 have joined ISIS--many of them disaffected youth from neighborhoods with limited educational opportunities--and the presence of extremist recruitment cells in Turkey\\'s southern provinces is well established. Although there is no evidence that the imam-hatips are a source of radicalization in Turkey, it is crowding out opportunities to build critical thinking and appreciation for other religions. That certainly does not help combat ISIS, an extremist group that justifies killing and raping of non-Muslim \"apostates.\"To be sure, the problem isn\\'t just a Turkish one. In ISIS-controlled areas of Iraq, the curriculum teaches the group\\'s extreme Salafist interpretation of Islam, with a focus on militancy and fighting \"non-believers,\" even at the primary school level. In Syria, even outside of ISIS\\' domain, radical Islamic groups such as Jabhat al Nusra have opened sharia schools where girls must where the niqab and are segregated from boys. And in Jordan, which has sent 2,000 fighters to ISIS, schoolbooks teach that \"holy war\" and the killing of captured enemies are appropriate responses to attacks on Islamic lands. Zogan Obiedat, a former Education Ministry official, recently warned, \"Islamic State ideology is there, in our textbooks.\" In fact, the Jordanian government has launched an initiative to rewrite its textbooks.For her part, Kacar insists that her fight is not against religious education for those that want it--she herself is a devout Sunni Muslim, although she did not go to an imam-hatip. She is fighting for the right to choose her child\\'s education, a principle enshrined in international law. But for now, it seems that Erdogan is winning. At the end of November, the courts had not given a ruling on any of Zeytinoglu\\'s five cases. Kacar was unable to keep her son at home any longer, and so he, along with hundreds of other children from Gongoren, started school in the next town over. ',\n",

       "  'text': '\"France is our oldest ally,\" U.S. President Barack Obama reminded Americans on November 13, after ISIS terrorists launched coordinated attacks in Paris, killing 130. Indeed, the French sent an ambassador to the breakaway colony back in 1778, and Benjamin Franklin arrived in Paris the next year, establishing the United States\\' first foreign mission. Gerard Araud, a career diplomat who began as a Middle East specialist, has served as French ambassador to the United States since September 2014; before that, he led France\\'s permanent mission to the UN. Araud spoke with Foreign Affairs deputy managing editor Stuart Reid at the French embassy in Washington, D.C., on December 16, 2015.The attacks on Paris were disturbing not just because of the loss of life but also because they struck a city that symbolizes openness. Have the attackers succeeded in jeopardizing the liberal values that Paris represents?The answer is no. But after such a terrorist attack, you are obliged to take some law-enforcement measures. Any liberal democracy has a delicate balance between civil liberties and law enforcement. After 9/11, you had the Patriot Act. After this attack, we have the state of emergency in France.More serious is that the attackers want to create a rift between French Muslims and other French citizens. The French authorities are very keen on avoiding it, but you saw the result of the recent elections in France, where the far right did very well.It\\'s a bit like Trump. Trumpism is a transatlantic phenomenon. The problem of backlash against Muslim citizens that you have in this country after San Bernardino, we have in Europe.Why have Muslim immigrants to France, and even their children and grandchildren, had trouble integrating?May I ask you why African Americans have problems of integrating 10 generations after they arrived in the U.S.?The fact is that in Europe, not only in France, most of the recent immigrants are Muslims. Thanks to the economic crisis exported by the U.S. in 2008, Europe is going through an economic dire strait, especially in southern Europe, where the unemployment rate is very high. As usual, the people who are hit most by unemployment are the last to arrive: the immigrants. So we have problems of integration. But you don\\'t blow yourself up because you are unemployed.When you look at the profile of Muslim terrorists, you discover that a lot of them were middle-class and had a job. Their parents were perfectly integrated. Very often, the profile of the radicalized youth is someone from a totally normal family that is Muslim, but in a very moderate way. And suddenly, they see their son or daughter getting radical--he starts not to touch his mother, starts to insult his sister because she wears Western clothing, and so on. Social integration is a challenge we all face. But the real question is the process of radicalization of a tiny part of the community.Why do U.S. conservatives love to bash France?    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-x90_2\");    });  Actually, right now, it\\'s the opposite. Conservatives in the U.S. love France because we were firm in negotiations with Iran, our soldiers are fighting in Mali against the terrorists, we were the first to join the American strikes against ISIS, and we have deployed an aircraft carrier in the Gulf to support the Americans.There has always been a tradition of French bashing, which is linked, I guess, to the fact that we are very two different countries. The U.S. was created against the British colonial state, so there is a tradition of considering the state the problem. Look at the guns issue. People say, \"We need guns in case the state becomes a threat.\" In France, we have a totally different relationship with the state. When Tocqueville came to America and wrote Democracy in America in 1835, he emphasized this point.On top of this misunderstanding, we have the Iraq crisis of 2003, where we were right, obviously. The American intervention was a total geopolitical disaster.We\\'ve gone from freedom fries to nous sommes tous franais.Exactement. What has been striking is the outpouring of American solidarity after the attack, from President Obama to the man in the street. Our embassy was totally overwhelmed by flowers, we have received thousands of messages, and people are still offering their condolences. Immediately after the November 13 attack, the U.S. administration was extremely supportive, especially in terms of intelligence sharing.We are shoulder to shoulder, facing the same challenge. The only difference is that thanks to your geography, you are much further from the danger than we are. But you have seen the same threat with San Bernardino.You mentioned the intervention in Mali. France has also intervened in the Central African Republic, and in 2013, President Hollande supported punishing Syria with airstrikes for using chemical weapons. What explains this more activist French foreign policy?Rather than seeing a general trend, look at each of these crises. In the case of Mali, the country was collapsing and could have been a failed state taken over by terrorists. It\\'s a former French colony, and the second-biggest Malian city is a suburb of Paris. We have hundreds of thousands of Malians in France, and these people are shuttling back and forth, so it would have been extremely dangerous for us. And West Africa was a French colony, where we still have thousands of French citizens and dozens of French schools. We had to intervene to defend our interests.In Central Africa, it\\'s totally different. It\\'s a very poor country. It has absolutely no interest in economic terms, so we didn\\'t have any appetite to intervene. But there were massacres between Muslims and Christians, and the public in France, contrary to the rest of the world, knows where the Central African Republic is, so there was pressure to end the slaughter. To be frank, the French army didn\\'t want to go. This sort of mission is always extremely frustrating. Nevertheless, it was so awful that we decided to send a few hundred soldiers.Speaking of Syria in 2013, do you think Obama\\'s decision not to go through with air strikes damaged U.S. credibility?I\\'m a French ambassador to the U.S., so I\\'m not going to criticize the president. But like my president has said publicly, you can always argue, but we think we could have changed the course of the war and should have proceeded with strikes against Assad.I can understand from the American perspective that core U.S. interests are not engaged in Syria. The problem is that for the Europeans--your most solid and ancient allies--the Syrian crisis is becoming critical. In terms of fighters, thousands of Europeans have gone to Syria, and they will come back. The second element is the more than one million migrants. Try to imagine what would happen in the U.S. if one million migrants were crossing the Rio Grande.What specifically could have been done earlier to prevent what\\'s happening now?The key problem from the beginning is Assad. In 2011, you had peaceful demonstrations in Syria, and at the same moment, you had peaceful demonstrations across the border in Jordan. But the Jordanians tried to respond to the political and social demands of the demonstrators, while the Syrian regime simply shot at the demonstrators. After that, little by little, it became a civil war. The problem with civil wars, as we\\'ve seen in Spain in \\'36-\\'39, is that usually, the moderates are not good soldiers, and the radicals are. The radical elements of the Syrian rebels have taken the upper hand. It\\'s hypothetical, but in 2013, it could still have been possible to get rid of Assad and have a palatable Syrian alternative. Now, it\\'s more difficult.Why has Vladimir Putin decided to intervene in Syria?The Russians have always been very clear. They said, \"We are not married to Assad, but the choice is between Assad and the radical Jihadists, and we prefer Assad.\" Why have they substantially increased their presence? In the spring and summer of 2015, we saw many signals that the Syrian army was exhausted. Obviously, the Russians and the Iranians thought they had to step in to preserve the Syrian regime. That\\'s the reason they are striking the opposition and not ISIS, because the people fighting Assad are the opposition and not ISIS.Is it possible the Russians are right that there is no good alternative to Assad at this point?What the Russians are telling us is, \"OK, you don\\'t like Assad, but that\\'s not the priority. The priority is fighting ISIS, so let\\'s fight ISIS together.\" And to fight and win, you need ground forces. If you look around the region, the Kurds are not going to fight ISIS, because they are defending Kurdistan. The Shiite militias from Baghdad are not going to fight ISIS, because they are defending their turf. They\\'re not going to go to Mosul; they don\\'t care about it. So you can say that the Assad army is the only solution. That\\'s more or less what the Russians are telling us.Our answer is twofold. First, the Syrian army is exhausted. They can\\'t do it. We estimate that around 40,000 Alawites have died, because the best forces are Alawites, and there are only 1.2 million of them. More important, ISIS is an answer to a real problem. We see ISIS only for its atrocities. Actually, ISIS is also filling a vacuum, which is Sunni-stan. With Assad on one side and the Shiites in Baghdad on the other, the Sunnis don\\'t have a defender, so ISIS has stepped in. And if we support Assad, it will encourage more Sunnis to rally to ISIS. So our answer is, yes, it will be up to the Syrian army to do the job--but an inclusive Syrian army, after political transition in Damascus.How can you be sure that France\\'s stepped-up air campaign doesn\\'t create more terrorists than it destroys?Frankly, at some point, when you have enemies, you have to kill them. It\\'s brutal, but it\\'s a war. What would be the other solution? These people come to our countries and blow themselves up in our theaters. They are threatening us every day--threatening the security of French schools, the security of French embassies abroad. They don\\'t leave us any other choice. We have to defeat them.What does a political settlement to the Syrian civil war look like?Our counter example is what the Americans did in Iraq. It\\'s very important to keep the security apparatus of the regime intact so that the country doesn\\'t collapse into total anarchy. We have to keep the Syrian army, we have to keep the Syrian security apparatus, we have to keep the administration at a high level.We have to have a government of national unity organizing elections to have a representative Syrian government. You can object, \"Is it possible to organize free elections with Assad? Is it possible to organize elections considering that the opposition is really fragmented?\" It\\'s quite a challenge.It won\\'t work if it\\'s imposed from outside. It will work only if the Syrians are exhausted enough. A civil war stops either with the total victory of one side or when the people say, \"enough is enough.\"What is the moral responsibility of France when it comes to accepting refugees from Iraq and Syria?There was an agreement between the EU countries to share the burden. France was supposed to take 24,000 refugees, and eventually, even after the attack, we are going to accept 30,000. We are facing the same situation that you are facing in terms of immigration. On one side, yes, there is a moral responsibility. We have to help these refugees. On the other side, we face the very strong reaction of the anti-immigrant movement.Also, and you can consider it a petty calculation, but the fact is, the more you accept immigrants, the more they come. We are in a dead end. We close our borders, these people are going to die on our shores, which is awful. We open our borders, and then there will be more people coming. And I don\\'t know any country that is ready to accept millions of refugees.What do you make of the Front National?It\\'s the same thing as Trump. Of course, Trump has his personal genius, but it\\'s basically the same crisis. The lower middle class feels frightened by globalization, frightened for the future of its children, frightened for its moral and social values. They have the impression that the elite are cut off from them. So they want to try something new. So it\\'s the Front National in France, or the extreme right in the Netherlands, or Mr. Trump. It\\'s the same solution: building walls, closing borders. And it\\'s the same scapegoat: the immigrant. It\\'s sad.Do you think the United Kingdom will opt to leave the EU?It\\'s possible, and it would be a disaster--for the U.K. and for the EU. We need the U.K. in the EU for a lot of different reasons. The problem is, to be frank, this is a British debate. No other country sees an interest in opening this debate.Does Germany have too much power within the EU?Countries have leverage proportional to their power. Because of its economic performance since the beginning of the crisis, Germany has a lot of influence. But if you ask the question to the Dutch, they will say that France and Germany and the U.K. have too much influence.You\\'re perhaps the feistiest diplomat on Twitter. Has this ever gotten you in trouble with your masters back in Paris?When you arrive in Washington, you wonder, what is the use of an ambassador in the modern world? The relationship between the two countries is so intense--in terms of human exchanges, economic exchanges, financial exchanges--that frankly, it can work without the ambassador. As for the political relationship, the national security advisor in Paris is calling Susan Rice, and they don\\'t need the ambassador. So I\\'ve said, \"Let\\'s try to use social media\"--not in terms of everybody in the country, but at least among journalists and deciders.Also, if you want to have real effectiveness, you have to be feisty. If you simply say, \"France is in favor of peace and stability,\" you\\'re not going to be exciting. You need to tease the audience to get their attention.It\\'s an experiment. I\\'m by far the French ambassador with the most followers, so Paris is following my experience. Maybe from time to time, they believe I went too far. But they have told me only once that I should delete a tweet. And I\\'m not going to tell you which.Speaking of one tweet you did delete, after Donald Trump tried to make a political point about gun control after the Paris attacks, you called him a \"vulture.\" Are most ambassadors too prudish about commenting on the domestic politics of the country that they\\'re in?I didn\\'t comment on domestic politics, because it was after he had said if the French had been allowed to have guns, it wouldn\\'t have happened. I was just driving back home, and it was in the moment of a tragedy. That\\'s the reason I reacted by saying he\\'s a vulture: the blood is still not dry, and already he\\'s making this sort of comment. Two hours later, I deleted it--I was not asked to by Paris--because I said, \"I\\'m not going to enter into a controversy while my people are being killed.\"I went on Fox News a few days later, and they said, \"Don\\'t you think that if guns had been available in France, the French could have defended themselves against terrorists?\" I simply said, \"No, it doesn\\'t work this way; it\\'s only in the movies.\" I came back home. On my Twitter account, I had hundred of insults--hundreds!--coming from people from Nevada, Arizona, with 45 followers.Have you been watching the Republican debates?  Yes.What\\'s your reaction?We are foreigners. I\\'ve always said to my diplomats, \"You should consider that we are different.\" A lot of people believe that Europeans and Americans are more or less alike, with small differences. And I think that approach is leading to misunderstanding. Actually, we are different--in our history, in our political traditions, in our visions of the world. ',\n",

       "  'text': 'Hunting giraffes with an AK-47 is not an activity that most people associate with the life of a terrorist, but for al Shabab, big game hunting is but one of the many perks of membership. A recent al Shabab video depicted fighters stalking and shooting giraffes, antelope, and buffalo, frolicking in a swimming hole, and sharing large plates of fresh fruit within Somalia\\'s lush expanses. Compared to the brutality of recruitment videos from the Islamic State (also known as ISIS), al Shabab is peddling a softer version of jihad.This take on jihadi life is not always standard fare for the Somali terror group. Al Shabab\\'s cinematic efforts often feature brutality and violence. This video, however, is part of an attempt to reinvigorate a key element of its rise that saw it become, for a time, one of the world\\'s most prominent terrorist organizations. By casting jihad as a life of adventure and excitement, al Shabab is again trying to lure Western recruits. And its chances of success grow daily.Al Shabab has always prized foreign recruits. In 2008, its spokesman Mukhtar Robow extolled foreign fighters as a \"precious element\" the group needed to attract. Particularly valued were battle-hardened terrorists from other conflict areas, including Afghanistan and Iraq, who brought fighting acumen, technological skills, and leadership experience. At one time, more than half of al Shabab\\'s governing council was thought to be non-Somali.Unskilled recruits from the West have been useful as well. Anywhere from 20 to 60 Somali-Americans joined al Shabab as novice fighters. At least three of them became suicide bombers; others became foot soldiers or propagandists. Several non-Somali Americans also joined the group, as did citizens of Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.  AMISOMA still from Al Shabab\\'s recruitment video, geared toward Western recruits.Al Shabab\\'s Western recruitment efforts dried up as word of the group\\'s brutality toward Somalis and non-Somalis (even those within the group) began to spread. Several attacks within Somalia also soured the public on al Shabab, notably the 2008 suicide attack on a Mogadishu medical school graduation. Its decision to bar aid from southern Somalia during the 2011-2012 famine did not help either; it led to a quarter of a million starvation deaths and destroyed what little support the group had within the Somalian diaspora.Since 2009, there have been few reports of Somali-Americans joining the group; radicalized Somali-Americans instead have preferred to join Middle Eastern terrorist groups such as ISIS. Still, al Shabab tries to woo Westerners back from time to time, and the giraffe-hunting video is the latest attempt. It features English narrations and subtitles, something the first two videos in the series did not, and shows several white terrorists speaking in what sounds like a British accent. And in place of executions and sermons that pepper many of their videos are bucolic scenes of bonhomie and carefree pleasures.This is typical of the propaganda that terrorist groups tailor to Westerners. ISIS, the most successful terrorist organization in terms of recruiting foreign fighters, has published an English-language guidebook on life in its self-styled caliphate that rhapsodizes about the ice cream one can supposedly get there. An al Qaeda manual for recruiters emphasizes building friendships with targets and convincing them that the media unfairly vilifies Islamist terrorists.  YouTubeA still from Al Shabab\\'s recruitment video, geared toward Western recruits.Al Shabab is working hard to rehabilitate its reputation with Muslims as part of its new tack. Over the last several years, the group has avoided civilian-focused attacks inside of Somalia in favor of government and military targets. In Kenya, a frequent al Shabab target, the group has also taken a softer approach toward Muslim communities, making a show of sparing Muslim lives during attacks as it tries to cast itself as a defense force against Christian aggression.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-x90_2\");    });  Al Shabab\\'s competition with ISIS for attention, funding, and fighters may lead it to send some of its members westward to sow terror.There are unfortunate trends within Somalia that increase the chances of success for al Shabab\\'s charm offensive. A 2006 Ethiopian invasion of Somalia prompted a nationalist backlash that swelled al Shabab\\'s ranks. Ethiopia demolished a coalition of sharia courts known as the Islamic Courts Union that had conquered swathes of southern Somalia, but ended up strengthening al Shabab as a result. Recruitment was not limited to Somalis, either: Westerners also joined in the invasion\\'s wake, eager to fight Ethiopian \"crusaders.\" Ethiopia has since retreated, but is now back in Somalia as part of the African Union Mission in Somalia. And although many Somalis welcome AMISOM\\'s efforts, some of its troops have been accused of raping and murdering civilians, stirring the population\\'s ire. The risk of a nationalist backlash against AMISOM grows daily, and is always good fodder for al Shabab recruitment.The danger of further Western recruitment is self-evident. It is rare for foreign fighters to return to their country of origin to continue the jihad, but the recent ISIS attack on Paris, which appears to have involved at least one terrorist returnee from Syria, could be a harbinger of things to come. If it is, al Shabab\\'s competition with ISIS for attention, funding, and fighters may lead it to send some of its members westward to sow terror. Doing so would provide the group with a reputational boost in a crowded market.  Fortunately, al Shabab\\'s attempts to win Westerners have been largely unsuccessful. Its continued unpopularity is part of the problem, but the rise of ISIS has contributed to the group\\'s troubles as well. ISIS is now dominating Western recruitment efforts, even among Somali-Americans.This does not mean, however, that the United States can be complacent. The U.S. government has focused on building bridges with the Somali-American community ever since it began losing citizens to al Shabab recruitment campaigns, and later to ISIS. But every day that AMISOM remains in Somalia to prop up Mogadishu\\'s sputtering central government, the risk that al Shabab can capitalize on nationalist resentment grows. ISIS may also have its own reputation problem brewing as unrest over its taxation and extortion practices mounts, which would make al Shabab\\'s cultural, linguistic, and religious overtures more attractive for radicalized Somali-Americans.Al Shabab is fighting an uphill battle, but there are several trends working in its favor. The United States is focusing its efforts on fighting ISIS and ISIS recruitment, for example. This is a worthy goal, but Washington cannot afford to overlook the threat posed by al Shabab. It is canny, adaptable, and determined to again win Western recruits--this time with potentially far worse consequences for the West. ',\n",

       "  'text': 'Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has made it clear that he has no interest in negotiating with rebels, whom he considers \"terrorists.\" His allies, Moscow and Tehran, also continue to rebuff demands for him to step down. So did it matter that, last week, members of the Syrian opposition repeated their calls for Assad\\'s removal in a conference in Riyadh? It is hardly consequential in the near term. But the conference\\'s goal--to put the Syrian opposition\\'s house in order--is a worthy one. In fact, it is critical for international efforts to end the civil war.Riyadh, along with Ankara and Doha, is committed to toppling Assad. Yet what all three capitals have finally realized is that the Syrian leader\\'s departure, whether by force or negotiation, cannot be achieved without a more coherent Syrian opposition that can speak with one voice in international fora and effectively join arms on the battlefield. Of course, unifying the huge mess that is the Syrian opposition is easier said than done. And it\\'s not like it hasn\\'t been tried before. Over the past four years, none of the attempts by various countries to unify the rebels and the politicians has worked. And so, Saudi Arabia will try to succeed where others before it have failed, even though its own record of bringing together rival Palestinian groups over the years has not been stellar.In a sense, Riyadh cannot afford to fail. A more integrated Syrian opposition is at the core of its diplomatic and military plans in Syria. If Russia and Iran continue to reject negotiations over Assad\\'s fate, Saudi Arabia\\'s response will be to work more closely with Turkey and Qatar and step up arms and money transfers to what they hope will be a more structured rebel apparatus. If Russia and Iran approve talks in January, the Saudi-Turkish-Qatari axis will want to rein in this new force and present it before the international community as a power that can negotiate with representatives of the regime.  Molhem Barakat / ReutersA fighter from the Tawhid Brigade, which operates under the Free Syrian Army, prepares homemade rockets to be thrown towards the 80th Brigade base in Aleppo, controlled by forces loyal to Syria\\'s President Bashar al-Assad, November 11, 2013.Whether Russia and Iran will choose escalation or accommodation partly depends on the nature of this newly shaped Syrian opposition. To assuage international concerns over terrorist infiltration within the opposition, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Qatar have tasked Jordan with creating a \"who\\'s who\" list of the Syrian rebels that would separate the \"terrorists\" from the \"moderates.\" The easy part is identifying adherents to the Islamic State (also known as ISIS) and Jabhat Al Nusra, the Syrian branch of al Qaeda. The hard part is vetting the rest of the Syrian rebel groups, with Moscow and Tehran breathing down Amman\\'s neck. Russia and Iran are closely monitoring the situation and are most concerned about the Saudi-sponsored JayshAlIslam, a collection of 12 rebel groups, and the Turkish- and Qatari-backed AhrarAlSham, an ultraconservative Islamist faction of more than 25,000 fighters with Syrian nationalist leanings.That both groups participated in last week\\'s conference in Riyadh suggests that they will not be labeled as terrorist groups, despite Ahrar Al Sham\\'s military entente and its sporadic coordination with Jabhat Al Nusra. The groups\\' involvement in the conference drew the ire of Russia and Iran, but their objections could be tempered if Saudi Arabia and Turkey manage to extract concessions from their surrogates.  Asking Ahrar Al Sham to meaningfully compromise won\\'t be easy because its negotiation ceiling is very high. Its maximalist demands include the establishment of Sharia law in any future Syrian state (which would undermine the secular nature of the state); the total dismantlement of the regime, including its security apparatus (which could lead to the collapse of order, similar to what happened in Iraq in 2003 after the undoing of the Iraqi state); and the rejection of any future government that is based on sectarian and ethnic quotas (even though Syrian society contains various sects and ethnicities, all of whom should be represented in any new political system).Students play during their break inside Hosam Kamel school in the rebel-controlled area of Maaret al-Numan town in Idlib province, Syria October 28, 2015.Despite these problematic demands, Ahrar Al Sham did sign off on the final communique that came out of the Riyadh conference, which clearly calls for an all-inclusive, civic state. It\\'s possible, of course, that the group plans to change its mind if and when the transition takes place and then impose its dogmatic preferences. But that is a risk probably worth taking because the alternative--the exclusion of one of the most powerful Syrian rebels groups--would be costly if it leads to Ahrar Al Sham effectively partnering with Jabhat Al Nusra. It is also possible that if the group assumes a political role that is commensurate with its size and power in a future Syrian state, the burden of governance might temper its mindset and make it more accepting of notions of political tolerance and pluralism. That\\'s a long shot, though, given its Salafi jihadi ideology.What helps considerably is that Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Qatar have leverage over their proxies--they can stop sending them weapons and money and helping them with intelligence and logistics. However, for these countries to exercise this leverage, Russia and Iran have to give something in return, and it starts with agreeing to a political transition that leads to Assad departing the political scene. There\\'s no way around it; no party in Syria will be able to achieve its objectives at the expense of its adversaries or without incurring enormous costs. It\\'s good that all regional powers agree that there is no military solution to the Syrian conflict. But this consensus is not enough. They now have to find a way to compromise to attain a political solution. This is where the real diplomacy resides. ',\n",

       "  'text': 'In recent weeks, several leading Republican presidential candidates have argued in favor of selectively sealing U.S. borders to Syrians and others. That--and the discontinuation of any Syrian refugee resettlement programs--they argue, will keep the United States safe from terrorist attacks. Such fantastical and ill-informed suggestions are counterproductive on their own terms, but they also distract from very real and consequential ways in which refugees and migrants are being used as political and military weapons.PEOPLE PUSHERSAll sides in the Syrian civil war have, to some extent, strategically engineered mass movements of civilians into and away from their areas of territorial control. In some cases, the systemic depopulation and repopulation of territory represent attempts to gain tactical military advantage. For example, in early October Amnesty International reported that the Democratic Union Party (PYD), a Kurdish rebel group in Syria, was demolishing homes and displacing entire villages in order to, as Mao would have put it, \"drain the sea [the civilians] in which the fish [the enemy] swims.\" The PYD is not alone. This kind of engineered migration has long been a tool of warfare, since noncombatants can provide safety, succor, and support and serve as a source of recruits.Conversely, civilians may also be prohibited from fleeing areas controlled by combatants, in order to shield soldiers and their supporters from military attack. Human Rights Watch reported in early November, for instance, that the rebel group Jaysh al-Islam has been keeping civilian hostages in northern Syria in order to deter attacks by government forces.  Brendan McDermid / ReutersPeople take part in an anti-Donald Trump, pro-immigration protest outside the Plaza Hotel, where U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump spoke, in the Manhattan borough of New York December 11, 2015. Trump vowed to close the borders to Muslims.In other cases, such demographic reengineering schemes appear to be longer-term bids to maintain or secure postwar control of particular pieces of Syrian real estate, through a strategy I have called \"dispossessive engineered migration,\" a subset of which is ethnic cleansing. It has been reported, for instance, that forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad have been selectively cleansing neighborhoods under their control and repopulating them with regime allies, some of whom are internally displaced people from elsewhere in Syria. Likewise, as War on the Rocks reported last week, the self-proclaimed Islamic State (also known as ISIS) has routinely used violence to encourage \"infidels\" to flee their lands and then offered their property and assets to incoming loyalists. This strategy of seizure and appropriation through forced migration, too, has a long and rather sordid history.But the weaponization of displaced people is not limited to conflict zones; migrants and refugees may also be used for influence far from the battlefield. For instance, during the first week of November, Jamal Zubia, spokesman for the National Salvation Government of Libya\\'s General National Congress--one of the two rival governments in Libya--issued a lightly veiled threat against the European Union: if not offered diplomatic recognition and financial assistance, it might actively assist migrants and asylum seekers in their bids to reach Europe. In an interview with The Telegraph, Zubia emphasized that although his Tripoli-based faction was not planning to follow through on its threat imminently, it might well do so in future: \"We are protecting the gates of Europe, yet Europe does not recognize us and does not want to recognize us. So why should we stop the migrants here? . . . It is a strategic threat, yes, but I would not rule out us doing it one day.\"The Libyan warning came close on the heels of analogous threats that Turkey reportedly made in September and October (and possibly earlier). According to The Wall Street Journal, Reuters, and other sources, Turkish demands on Europe included financial aid to mitigate the significant burden of hosting more than two million Syrians, the lifting of EU-related visa restrictions on Turkish travelers, and the reinvigoration of Turkey\\'s EU membership bid. By some accounts, Ankara also renewed an earlier demand for the creation of a \"safe zone\" along the Syrian border.In both the Libyan and Turkish cases, the underlying message was clear: concede to our demands or face (possibly severe) migration-related consequences. Although the Libyan threat apparently remains latent for the moment, a number of Turkish demands have already been met, including an initial three billion euros in aid and the resuscitation of Ankara\\'s EU membership bid, according to The New York Times, the BBC, and other sources.Using migration as an instrument of state-level coercion is nothing new. Since the 1951 Refugee Convention came into force, there have been at least 75 attempts by state and nonstate actors to use displaced people as means to political, military, and economic ends. Coercers\\' demands have ranged from the simple provision of financial aid to requests for full-scale invasion and assistance in effecting regime change. Such was the case when the exiled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide used the threat of a flood of Haitian boat people into the United States to persuade the administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton to oust the sitting junta and restore him to power in September 1994.Likewise, former Libyan leader Muammar al-Qaddafi rather dramatically promised to \"turn Europe black\" if the EU failed to meet his demands. Although his objectives varied widely over time--and ranged from the lifting of sanctions to the provision of billions of euros in aid to the quashing of support for protesters in the early days of what became the Libyan uprising--Qaddafi used this tool with varying degrees of success in 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2010, before fatally overplaying his hand in 2011.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-x90_2\");    });  In nearly three-quarters of the historical cases, the coercers achieved at least some of their objectives. In well over half of the documented cases, they obtained all or nearly all of what they sought, which makes this tactic more effective, albeit harder to successfully manage and control, than either economic sanctions or traditional, military-backed coercive diplomacy.Even more striking, some threats to deploy refugees and migrants as weapons have actually been carried out. In the spring of 1999, then Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic initially threatened and later expelled hundreds of thousands of Kosovars in an attempt first to deter NATO from launching a bombing campaign during the Kosovo war and then to compel the alliance into ceasing it. Former German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer later admitted his regret in not taking Milosevic seriously when he said that he \"could empty Kosovo in a week.\"Former Cuban President Fidel Castro also used migration as a weapon against the United States on at least three occasions: in 1965, in 1994, and, most famously, during the Mariel boatlift of 1980. As with Qaddafi, Castro\\'s objectives and demands varied over time but included, among other things, a significant shift in US policy toward Cuban hijackers and the regularization of U.S.-Cuban immigration.FIGHTING BACKDespite its prevalence, this kind of coercion has historically been underreported. For one thing, coercive threats are often issued privately and bilaterally; in many cases, neither coercers nor their targets have incentives to reveal the political blackmail. For another, this kind of coercion is sometimes intertwined with other political considerations. For example, Ugandan leader Idi Amin expelled most Asians from his country in 1972, in what has commonly been interpreted as a naked asset grab, since Asians owned most of the big businesses in Uganda during that period. Far less noted is the fact that approximately 50,000 of those who were pushed out held British passports and that these expulsions happened at the same time Amin was demanding that the British halt a planned drawdown of military assistance to his country. Amin even announced his intention to foist 50,000 refugees on the British, with a convenient 90-day grace period for the country to reconsider its decision on military aid.As in the Ugandan case, the vast majority of known targets of this kind of coercion have been liberal democracies (over 70 percent); another 11 percent have been groups of countries that have included liberal democracies. This is no accident. Liberal democracies tend to be particularly vulnerable because they find themselves trapped between conflicting imperatives. On the one hand, such states generally have made normative and legal commitments to protect those fleeing violence and persecution. On the other, as recent events in Europe and the United States make clear, some segments of democratic polities are strenuously opposed to accepting displaced people, whether for rational economic, political, or cultural reasons or for irrational, xenophobic ones. Because targets cannot simultaneously embrace a given group of migrants and reject them, the incentives to concede to coercers\\' demands and make the problem disappear can be compelling.  So what options do potential targets of migration-driven coercion have? There are several, but none is a silver bullet; each has advantages and drawbacks. Targets can concede, but this carries the risk that coercers may repeat and escalate their demands, as Qaddafi did in the 2000s. Alternatively, targets can take military action to change conditions on the ground in countries of origin. But wars are costly and their outcomes uncertain. Again, the Qaddafi example is instructive: the threat of Libyan coercion did not disappear when he did, and subsequent instability in the country and the region does not inspire confidence about the option of regime change.Alternatively, target governments can appeal to their populations to welcome the displaced, emphasizing the long-term economic virtues of migration, particularly for countries suffering declining birthrates and shrinking tax bases. If this strategy succeeds, coercion becomes impossible because threats of \"flooding\" will, in theory, be met with a shrug. But this kind of attitude change tends to be the result of a long-term campaign. The strategy is generally not effective in the midst of an ongoing migration emergency. And it would be particularly challenging in the wake of the attacks in Paris, in light of the fact that at least one of the ISIS-aligned attackers traveled to Europe in the midst of a stream of displaced people.Finally, and conversely, targeted states can abrogate their commitments, close their borders, and lock their doors. This, too, makes successful migration-driven coercion difficult, if not impossible. However, such a stance often encourages others to follow suit and would represent an abandonment of key components of liberal democracies\\' most enviable values. In the end, the long-term costs to liberal morals, philosophy, and identity may be far greater than any short-term humanitarian- and assimilation-related costs that come from accepting migrants and refugees, the real victims of this kind of coercion. Such an approach is also very unlikely to solve migration-related security concerns. Indeed, sealing the borders to migrants and refugees may ironically help feed jihadist narratives, which in turn may sow the seeds for a different kind of weaponization of the displaced. ',\n",

       "  'text': 'Across Russia, from St. Petersburg in the north to Volgograd in the south, truckers are on strike. They\\'re angered by a new road tax that they say is rooted in corruption and will bankrupt them. And so, some 200 long-haul drivers have disrupted roads for over two weeks and have vowed to take their motorized protest to Moscow unless the Russian government removes the tax, fires the transport minister, and fines the oligarch Arkady Rotenberg and his son, whose company was selected to collect the new fees.In the region and beyond, similar movements that were catalyzed by grievances about corruption and involved diverse groups of protesters, including young people, professionals, and blue-collar workers, have toppled other regimes, including that of Viktor Yanukovych in next-door Ukraine. In his increasingly authoritarian rule, Russian President Vladimir Putin has often denouncedsuch revolts, presumably fearing the same fate. Now he must be especially worried. Past protests in Russia have typically been confined to Moscow and attracted mostly liberal elites, so dissent from a blue-collar constituency hailing from the heartland can\\'t be good news.Although there\\'s a chance that this nonviolent civil resistance might catalyze broader action, whether it will produce a democratic breakthrough depends on the desire and ability of the truckers--and the others now joining them--to diversify their support base, tap into economic and ethnic grievances nationwide, and organize.  Maxim Shemetov / ReutersA participant wears a T-shirt with an image of Russian President Vladimir Putin during an opposition protest march in Moscow, June 12, 2013.The Russian truckers\\' resistance reveals growing unhappiness among ordinary Russians. Although the drivers insist that their protests are strictly over economic issues and that many of them support Putin, in reality, tax policies, inflation, and corruption are highly political issues. The Russian economy is ailing: oil prices are in steady decline, inflation is up 15 percent, the economy is expected to contract by almost four percent in 2015, and average real incomes are set to lose an additional five percent this year. U.S. and European sanctions imposed on Russia following its annexation of Crimea and the war in eastern Ukraine have hobbled the banking, energy, and arms sectors and look set to be renewed. Meanwhile, Russia is now actively involved in two wars--in Ukraine and in Syria--a further drain on the national treasury.The truckers have avoided attacking Putin directly, but it is hard to ignore the politics in the protest signs: \"Rotenberg is worse than ISIS\" and\"Russia without Rotenberg,\" an echo of the 2011 protest slogan \"Russia without Putin.\" The Rotenbergs, close allies of Putin\\'s, some of whom are sanctioned by the United States, would be in charge of levying the tax and taking 20 percent of the proceeds. If the truckers face resistance from the Kremlin, or if their demands go unmet, there is a chance that they will become further politicized. The truckers are at least renewing the idea of civic action in their country. Protest parades and rallies have become rare in Putin\\'s Russia, as his government has slammed civil society with a series of draconian crackdowns. Groups such as the lauded Memorial human rights organization and the Association of NGOs in Defense of Voters\\' Rights (Golos in Russian) have been forced to close their doors.  Maxim Shemetov / ReutersA police officer walks past a line of trucks, whose drivers are taking part in a protest against a new fee, at a parking lot in the Moscow region, Russia, December 8, 2015.According to the Russian youth activist Oleg Kozlovsky, the truckers\\' revolt has led to a debate within Russian civil society about whether the resistance has staying power. Although the obstacles to forming a mass movement in Russia are daunting, it is never easy to predict when the sparks will ignite widespread civic action. Even TASS, Russia\\'s official news agency, noted in an \"expert opinion\" on November 20 that the truckers\\' protest posed a threat because it tapped into the anger of a bread-and-butter constituency.Although the truck drivers have met with activists and other opposition groups, including activists who have brought them food during protests, they have prevented members of opposition parties from handing out leaflets at their rallies. They believed that such actions were too political and could distract from their cause. In any case, the real threat to Putin is not a Maidan-like movement centered in Moscow--that is, a mass mobilization in the capital that would take over the government--but rather a movement that taps into the anti-Moscow undercurrent that is alive throughout Russia. Discontent has spread as Putin has stripped the regions of powers delegated to them by former leader Boris Yeltsin, including tax authority and the election of governors, while saddling them with forced reforms dictated by Moscow, the so-called May orders, which included plans for economic development, reforms in state administration, and various social reforms, including health-care and ethnic policies. Resentment is growing, too, as regional debt rises and social services are cut to pay for Putin\\'s overseas adventures.  If dispersed regional demonstrations attract the participation of aggrieved ethnic groups, many of which have their own republics within Russia, they may pose the biggest threat to Putin\\'s grip on power. It is more difficult to brand millions of ordinary people as \"traitors\" and \"CIA agents\" than a relatively small number of liberal challengers in the capital. According to a recent poll by the Levada Center and reported by Bloomberg News, most Moscow residents are strongly supportive of the truckers\\' strike. One-third of the capital city\\'s residents \"definitely support\" the protest, while 38 percent said they were \"probably in agreement.\"  Maxim Shemetov / ReutersPeople shout slogans during the \"March of Millions\" protest rally in Moscow, September 15, 2012. Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched though Moscow under streaming banners, flags and balloons on Saturday to demand an end to President Vladimir Putin\\'s long rule and to breathe life into their protest movement.Putin, like most authoritarian leaders, is aware of the threat and will do everything in his power to stop the revolt from spreading, including by offering minor concessions.So far, his government has refused to engage in direct talks with the truckers. But the Duma did vote to dramatically reduce the fine for noncompliance with the new law. Perhaps hinting at what could come, Ilya Ponomarev, the only member of the Russian Duma who voted against the annexation of Crimea (and later went into exile), insists that change will come to Russia, but it will take time. He says it will happen through a combination of popular pressure and elites turning on Putin.Research shows that bottom-up nonviolent movements involving strikes, protests, and other acts of civil disobedience attract ten times the level of citizen participation as armed insurgencies, and they are twice as likely to succeed. Popular nonviolent movements also correlate with democratic consolidation. Movements don\\'t succeed, however, because of spontaneous outbursts of dissent. They succeed because of organization, planning, and wide popular support. If nothing else, the truckers have sounded an alarm that the Kremlin has undoubtedly heard loud and clear. ',\n",

       "  'text': 'In 2010, a disturbing report made its entry into an already upsetting news cycle. Members of a U.S. Army brigade, assembled into a self-proclaimed \"kill team,\" had indiscriminately targeted civilians in southern Afghanistan. As trophies for their deeds, the soldiers collected fingers, leg bones, and skulls from their victims. Photos taken by the soldiers posing next to dead bodies came to light, along with the fact that the main instigator kept tally of each victim by having skulls tattooed on his calf.Such news reports, a sadly recurring feature of contemporary life, trace a predictable arc. The initial horror quickly subsides in the face of official reassurances and the unrelenting tide of other news. Should the public seek to draw lasting political conclusions from such horrors, it will be predictably reminded that there is only one: that an atavistic darkness has lurked in the hearts of man since the emergence of the species.Even a cursory reflection on the available facts, however, shows that such atrocities are not aberrations committed in a political vacuum. Calvin Gibbs, the main instigator of the kill team in Afghanistan, bragged about having done the same things during the occupation of Iraq. But collecting the remains of the enemy was also widely practiced by American soldiers during the Vietnam War. And when Gibbs referred to the victims of his grisly deeds as \"dirty savages,\" he was, consciously or not, tapping into an entrenched history of conquest and occupation.The horrors of the past live in the horrors of the present, and a responsible engagement with the latter requires an understanding of the former. But if a sense of historical continuity is indispensible in dealing with contemporary problems, it would also be incorrect to paint such continuities with too broad a brush. War and violence have been with us for a long time. But the political and economic parameters through which they are produced and reproduced today are part of a historical epoch of which the present is regrettably still a part: the epoch of imperialism. Indeed, after a long hiatus, when it was seemingly banished to the wilderness of esoteric academic debate, \"imperialism\" is once again a buzzword, either nervously invoked as an old specter to avoid or embraced as a positive good.  Morteza Nikoubazl / ReutersAn Iranian girl carries an anti-U.S. placard bearing an image of U.S. President Barack Obama in Tehran, January 13, 2012.Not surprisingly, the sudden popularity of the term has created great confusion about what it means and why we should care about it. Part of the difficulty is that \"imperialism\" is used to refer to a hugely diverse range of economic, political, cultural, and linguistic phenomena across centuries and continents. From the Persian empire of antiquity to contemporary American military operations in the Middle East, from China\\'s economic penetration of Africa to the old Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, every real or perceived form of hierarchy or privilege has been called imperialism. But such broad use of the term deprives it of analytical meaning; that is why it is useful to briefly examine the emergence and evolution of the term itself.Although \"empire\" has long historical roots, the term \"imperialism\" is a relatively recent innovation, making its entrance onto the world stage well into the second half of the nineteenth century. What began as a matter of domestic policy was projected onto the international arena. Initially used to describe the policies of Napoleon III in the 1860s, \"imperialism\" gradually came to be associated with the new surge of colonial acquisitions by European states. By the 1890s, both supporters and opponents of colonial expansion routinely used the term \"imperialism\" in their debates over the direction of their societies and, indeed, the world. The term referred to the frenzied struggle that had broken out for a share of the rapidly shrinking pool of territories available for colonial control.Some observers of the day insisted that, in spite of certain superficial similarities, these were not like the vulgar empires of the past, at least in an economic sense. Men like Cecil Rhodes proudly wore the mantle of \"imperialist,\" not just because of the immense wealth that was being accumulated in the enterprise but also because imperialism promised a solution to the problem of maintaining social order at home. As Rhodes argued, the only way to deal with a burgeoning working class in England was to ensure high rates of profits that would trickle down to them, as well as to acquire new territories where they could migrate. Moreover, the benefits of imperialism would extend beyond the great unwashed at home by bringing civilization into the farthest and darkest corners of the world.Lenin insisted that imperialism was not just a misguided set of policies with lamentable human consequences but a full-fledged economic and political system on a global scale that had to be confronted as such.This happy picture of imperialism didn\\'t persuade all. The rise of the international socialist movement in particular set the stage for a decisive turn in the way imperialism was understood and used in the broader political discourse. As the great powers of the day hurtled into what would come to be known as the First World War, the Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin wrote a short, explosive pamphlet that laid out the origins, the trajectory, and the essentially undemocratic, exploitative nature of imperialism. Building on the work of other writers such as British liberal John Hobson and the Austrian Marxist Rudolf Hilferding, Lenin insisted that imperialism was not just a misguided set of policies with lamentable human consequences but a full-fledged economic and political system on a global scale that had to be confronted as such.What made Lenin\\'s argument persuasive was that fact that, in spite of the efforts to present the enterprise as civilizing and mutually beneficial, the reality of life for the vast majority of the colonized populations remained a scathing and irrefutable indictment of imperialism. Moreover, despite their rhetorical commitment to the \"right to self-determination,\" the victors of the war to end all wars not only divided up the remains of the Ottoman Empire among themselves but also justified their continued right to colonial rule through the mandate system of the new League of Nations. In other words, they maintained the old imperialist reality through new forms, setting the stage for future conflicts.In this context, the fact that the Bolsheviks not only renounced the territorial acquisitions of tsarist Russia but also publicly disavowed the tsar\\'s secret treaties with the other powers only strengthened their anti-imperialist credentials. Even in the throes of a struggle for its own survival, the new Soviet government sought to rally anti-imperialist elements from both colonial as well as colonized countries. In 1920, the Soviet government organized the Congress of the Peoples of the East in Baku. The meeting, attended by over 1,800 delegates from Asia and Europe, linked the fate of the Soviet Union to the defeat of imperialism. Later on, even as the political climate in the Soviet Union had changed considerably, leaders from Asia and Africa sought and received the support of the Communist International to create the League Against Imperialism in 1927.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-x90_2\");    });  \"Imperialism\" gave way to terms such as \"Orientalism,\" which looked at the historical encounter between the West and the rest of the world through the prism of cultural studies, rather than politics and economics.Over the course of the next two decades, as nationalist movements around the world became more and more prominent, and as the great powers hurtled toward another catastrophic global conflict, the claim that imperialism was in any way beneficial to the colonized became impossible to sustain. The decolonization of the Third World, beginning after World War II, seemed to confirm this prognosis. Yet this process, which in some instances took the form of an orderly transfer of power between governments, posed new questions. On the one hand, the fall of the empires and the formal political independence of the former colonies appeared to be a significant achievement. On the other hand, exploitation, subjugation, and inequality, to say nothing of conflict and war, could hardly be said to have come to an end in the international arena.The criticism of lingering forms of hierarchy and inequality began to be expressed more in the cultural vein. \"Imperialism\" gave way to terms such as \"Orientalism,\" which looked at the historical encounter between the West and the rest of the world through the prism of cultural studies, rather than politics and economics.Imperialism had, after all, come to be associated with Marxist politics and, by extension, with the Soviet Union, particularly in the Western academy. By the 1970s, although discomfort with capitalism at home and abroad had far from disappeared, leftists no longer took seriously the notion that a new kind of society was being built behind the Iron Curtain. Many were keen to point out that if the term \"imperialism\" remained useful, it should be applied first and foremost to the relation between the Soviet Union and its satellites. \"Imperialism,\" as a concept and as shorthand for a certain way to understand the world, was a casualty of this intellectual and political process.The decline in the usage of the term became precipitous in the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union. The end of the Cold War and the declaration of a \"new world order\" set the stage for claims about the possibilities, if not yet the actuality, of an epoch that would no longer be governed by competition and conflict among great powers. In lieu of the old paradigms, humanitarianism would finally be allowed to bloom. The developments of the 1990s--the Gulf War, the establishment of the international tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, the interventions in Somalia, Bosnia, Kosovo, the signing of the Rome Statute leading to the institution of the International Criminal Court--were hailed as steps fulfilling the great expectations of this era. By the turn of the century, it appeared as though imperialism (both the term and the phenomenon) was a historical relic.  Goran Tomasevic / ReutersU.S. Marine Corp Assaultman Kirk Dalrymple watches as a statue of Iraq\\'s President Saddam Hussein falls in central Baghdad in this April 9, 2003 file photo.Within a couple of years, however, imperialism was suddenly back in fashion. Scholars and policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic began making the claim that imperialism had been given a bad rap by leftists, left-leaning nationalists, and ivory tower academics who were unwilling to recognize the hard realities of the past century. The imperialism practiced by liberal states (Britain in the past and the United States in the present), it turned out, was not just beneficial but actually necessary to maintain peace and stability in the world. This, they argued, was particularly true given the large number of failed and failing states that constituted the formerly colonized regions of the world. Not coincidentally, this area included Afghanistan and Iraq, the two countries invaded by the United States in the aftermath of 9/11.Such claims have waned since the inaugural salvos of Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. To a considerable extent, that is a measure of the character, duration, and costs of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. But the arguments about the relevance of imperialism continue to resonate, though perhaps not as originally intended. Mainstream policymakers and political pundits no longer openly associate themselves with the language of imperialism. Once imperialism is invoked, however, its specter is not so easy to banish. It now haunts the discussions surrounding the fallout from NATO\\'s war in Libya, the machinations in Ukraine, and the demands for another intervention in Syria.  Was NATO\\'s intervention in Libya in 2011 a manifestation of imperialism, even though it was sanctioned by the UN Security Council? Does the seemingly universal concern for humanitarianism and human rights rule out the applicability of imperialism to contemporary politics? Should any sort of predatory foreign policy be regarded as imperialist? The answers to these questions, we believe, can only be found through a sustained historical analysis of the nature and development of imperialism. From the 9/11 attacks to the revolutions in the Middle East; from the persistence of illiberal states to the deterioration of basic democratic rights in the advanced capitalist countries; from the recurring economic crises culminating with the yet unresolved meltdown of 2008 to the bloody wars that continue to wrack every region of the world, imperialism, we argue, remains at the heart of the recent events and ongoing processes that define contemporary politics. Understanding imperialism therefore, is not merely an intellectual endeavor, but rather the most important step in finding a way out of the tragic impasse that characterizes global politics today.Reprinted from Imperialism Past and Present by Emanuele Saccarelli and Latha Varadarajan with permission from Oxford University Press, Inc.

       "  'text': '\"Britain has got its mojo back,\" declared British Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne in a speech at the Council of Foreign Relations in New York last week. His comments followed a vote in the House of Commons that authorized British airstrikes in Syria. British allies greeted the decision with relief--the vote appeared to reverse what some critics viewed as the United Kingdom\\'s inexorable retreat from the world stage.Those critics argued that the United Kingdom had adopted an increasingly parochial attitude toward the rest of the world. They pointed to budget cuts in the military and diplomatic corps, a reluctance to join the campaign against the self-proclaimed Islamic State (also known as ISIS), an approach to China that prioritized narrow economic interest over broader strategic concerns, an inability to formulate a strategy to respond to Russian aggression in Ukraine, and British skepticism toward the European Union, with a referendum on membership of the EU likely to take place in 2016.Over the last couple of months, the British government has certainly taken steps to address some of its foreign policy shortcomings--a process no doubt facilitated by the terrorist attacks in Paris. The vote in the House of Commons was the clearest illustration, as British parliamentarians finally cleared the way for the United Kingdom to join the coalition against ISIS in Syria. The United Kingdom\\'s military contribution will only have a marginal impact. To date, British airstrikes have carried out around eight percent of the total carried out against ISIS in Iraq. But the political signal was much more valuable, particularly in the wake of explicit calls by the French government for British assistance.How lasting these changes prove to be, however, and whether they represent the germs of a coherent strategic approach to foreign relations, still remains to be seen.A FORCE AWAKENS?Ten days after the Paris attacks, the prime minister announced a 12 billion pound (about $18 billion) increase in the defense equipment budget over the next decade. Some of this money will go toward filling known gaps, including funding nine maritime patrol aircraft to address the threat posed by Russian submarines. Two days later, the Foreign Office avoided further cuts when George Osborne delivered his autumn statement and spending review in November, setting out the government\\'s spending priorities for the next five years.These are positive signs. But important challenges remain, including how best to address the remaining shortfalls in defense spending. And if future tax revenues fail to meet Osborne\\'s expectations, any increases in spending that do pass now may be temporary.But more important than budgetary concerns is whether the United Kingdom will rediscover what former Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir Nick Houghton has called the \"courageous instinct\" to commit militarily, including the deployment of ground forces when the need arises. The government has ruled out the commitment of boots on the ground in Syria. And its reluctance to get too deeply embroiled mirrors public opinion. Whereas 59 percent of the public supported British airstrikes against ISIS on November 17, only 48 percent did by December 1.  Russell Cheyne / ReutersA Royal Air Force Tornado takes off from RAF Lossiemouth with the moon in the background, in Scotland, December 2015.Beyond the immediate threats confronting the country, the United Kingdom\\'s broader approach to international affairs still remains ambiguous. Chinese leader Xi Jinping\\'s visit to London in October reignited fears about the United Kingdom\\'s willingness to put economic gain above the defense of the liberal international system. The British government treated the Chinese president to a lavish welcome--at Buckingham Palace, 10 Downing Street, the prime minister\\'s country house at Chequers, and Westminster Palace. British ministers again avoided mention of any of the fraught geopolitical issues provoked by China\\'s rise. At some point, the government will face the consequences of continuing to affirm its attachment to its Western allies while relentlessly pursuing narrow economic advantage in its dealings with Beijing. If the Chinese openly threaten the rules based international order, the United Kingdom may have to choose between loyal membership of the Western club and being, in Osborne\\'s words, China\\'s \"best friend in the West.\"    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-x90_2\");    });  And, of course, there remains the elephant in the room. Although British Prime Minister David Cameron has pledged solidarity with the French, he also maintains that he may still campaign for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. His decision, he claims, will hinge on his success in getting what he wants from his \"renegotiation\" with other member states.Europe has not been so insecure since the end of the Cold War.It is hard to show solidarity with European partners while holding ransom the very club they depend on to help them confront their challenges. It has not escaped attention that some of Cameron\\'s demands are trivial, such as his insistence on increasing the competitiveness of the European economy, a goal the European Commission is already pursuing.There could hardly be a worse time for the United Kingdom to rock the EU boat. Europe has not been so insecure since the end of the Cold War. And these insecurities require collective responses. It is because European sanctions on Russia are collective that they have inflicted the pain they have. If Europeans are serious about stabilizing other parts of the world--if only to prevent future waves of migrants--their actions must be collective.    Suzanne Plunkett / ReutersBritain\\'s Prime Minister David Cameron leaves Downing Street in London, December, 2015.Perhaps the United Kingdom has indeed turned a corner. Perhaps the Paris attacks and the vocal criticism of the United Kingdom\\'s foreign policy have provoked a serious reconsideration. But Cameron is a tactician rather than a strategist, and whether these short-term measures signal a durable shift toward longer-term engagement remains to be seen.Finally, domestic politics will play a part. Cameron has announced that he will step down before the 2020 election. Osborne\\'s New York speech formed part of an increasingly clear attempt to appear prime ministerial by playing a more prominent role in foreign policy. Osborne is more responsible than anyone else for the close relationship that the United Kingdom has built with Beijing. With a leadership struggle on the horizon, the United Kingdom\\'s newfound solidarity with its Western partners may remain tentative. Yet if the country has not resumed a central role in world affairs, it has at least not turned its back on the international stage entirely. ',\n",

       "  'text': 'As Syrian civilians suffer ceaseless indiscriminate attacks, millions of their compatriots flee their homes, and the self-proclaimed Islamic State (also known as ISIS) extends its killing beyond Syria and Iraq, the only good news coming out of the Middle East\\'s most violent conflict is that the contours of a deal to end it have become clearer. After talks in Vienna in late October, the main foreign actors in Syria\\'s civil war issued a declaration outlining the principles that could guide some of the conflict\\'s combatants toward a political settlement. The Vienna declaration calls for secular governance, the eventual defeat of ISIS \"and other terrorist groups,\" the maintenance of the country\\'s prewar borders, and the protection of minority groups and state institutions, among other provisions. Yet it fails to address a key issue: how the warring parties might build the trust needed to achieve such goals. As negotiators prepare for a new round of talks in New York in late December or early January, it is essential that they address trust building head-on, above all by demanding an end to the attacks on civilians that are driving Syrians apart and by sidelining the people who have been responsible for them.BOTTOM LINESBy now, it should be clear that none of the Syrian combatants are capable of prevailing militarily. Even with Russia\\'s entry into the war and the backing of Hezbollah and Iranian troops, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\\'s forces have not been able to make significant advances against the rebels. Nor have opposition fighters managed to make much of a dent in the government-held corridor between Damascus and the Mediterranean coast. The stalemate should convince all involved of the need for a political compromise.  Alaa Al-Faqir / REUTERSA building damaged by what activists said was shelling by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in Bosra al-Sham, Syria, September 2015.If it is to have a chance of succeeding, such a compromise must be based not on the wish lists of the warring parties but on their bottom lines. The armed opposition groups and some of their foreign backers would like to see Assad and his chief lieutenants leave office tomorrow. After all, these Syrian officials have been the architects of a brutal strategy of indiscriminate attacks in opposition-held areas, with the apparent aim of depopulating those regions and showing other civilians the consequences of rebel control. Yet apart from those extremist groups seeking to break the country apart, it is in no one\\'s interest for the Syrian state to implode, as might result from the abrupt departure of Assad without a replacement plan, because that could produce even greater violence. The maintenance of the security forces and a functioning justice system will be especially important, since their collapse would lead to a loss of order that would particularly endanger Syria\\'s many minorities. In other words, a managed transition away from the Assad regime is the best course.Achieving an accord depends on developing a level of trust among Syria\\'s many warring factions that is currently lacking. Assad and his chief lieutenants, of course, would like to stay in power indefinitely. But given their countless atrocities--the use of chemical weapons; the repeated barrel bombing of civilian neighborhoods and institutions; the mass detention, torture, and execution of perceived opponents--the opposition has made clear that it will never accept their rule in the long term. Even Russia has hinted that it is not wedded to Assad so long as he leaves through negotiation rather than popular revolt, and Iran has repeated a similar line. Both countries seem more concerned with the friendliness of the regime in Damascus than with who heads it. Assad does represent a powerful faction in the fighting, so there is no avoiding his having a place at the negotiating table, but since his continued rule is untenable, Russia and Iran will need to use their considerable clout to insist on--and enforce--a deal that leads to his departure.AMNESTIES AND ACCOUNTABILITYSo what will happen to Assad if he and his murderous cronies relinquish power under pressure? They will undoubtedly push for amnesty for their crimes, but for a number of reasons, amnesty should not be granted. As a general rule, since the early 1990s, the international community has rightly refused to give its imprimatur to amnesties for mass atrocities; doing so is required by international law, respects the victims, and avoids encouraging further atrocities. Moreover, an amnesty in Syria would be meaningless in some respects. Although Syria is not a current member of the International Criminal Court, any future internationally recognized Syrian government would be empowered to join it and consent to retroactive jurisdiction; should that happen, the court would never accept an amnesty for mass atrocities. Foreign courts exercising universal jurisdiction over alleged Syrian war criminals found on their territory would also be free to ignore an amnesty. Even within Syria, an amnesty could prove ineffective: amnesties for atrocities granted under the pressure of violence have been deemed invalid in such places as Argentina, Chile, and Peru.  Brendan Smialowski / Pool / ReutersRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, and Turkish Foreign Minister Feridun Sinirlioglu in Vienna, October 2015.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-x90_2\");    });  That said, most negotiators probably do not expect Assad to deliver himself to custody in The Hague, and few would object if he and his henchmen fled to Moscow or Tehran, leaving for another day the question of whether they could later be apprehended for trial. If they stay in Syria, as Assad has vowed to do, the key would be to reject any attempt to foreclose a future reckoning through a formal amnesty.Other forms of accountability should be wholly non-negotiable and should begin as soon as possible. For starters, the transitional government should include a truth commission with subpoena power to build a detailed historical record of all sides\\' atrocities, to collect evidence for future prosecutions, and to establish a system of compensation for victims and their families. And anyone found through an open, contested, and fair process to have been responsible for significant abuses, including Assad and his coterie, should be barred from public office.PARTICIPATORY GOVERNANCEIf Assad and his circle are precluded from holding power, who would replace them? According to the Vienna declaration, that question would be answered by UN-supervised elections. But credible elections in war-torn Syria, where millions have been displaced, will take considerable time and preparation. Initially, then, it will be necessary to establish a coalition government by agreement, led by figures with credibility among both Syria\\'s Sunni majority and the Alawite and other minorities that have largely entrusted their fate to Assad. Syrians participating in the negotiations would determine the components of this coalition--the Vienna declaration calls for \"credible, inclusive, non-sectarian governance\"--but the possibility for compromise would increase greatly if the international community demanded that the future leadership of Syria exclude people who have been found responsible for mass atrocities. That position is necessary not only for reasons of accountability but also because it is difficult to imagine any consensus forming around those who have committed such crimes.As for the structure of such a coalition-led government, given Syria\\'s history of repression at the hands of a strong central government--and the multiplicity of forces controlling various parts of the country--a hefty dose of local self-rule will probably be unavoidable. At least at the outset, that would place a great deal of governmental authority in a collection of fiefdoms rather than a strong, centrally directed state. Such decentralization would have to be accompanied by guarantees that all groups living under these coalition forces, including minorities, can participate in local governance--at a minimum, through formal consultative processes. The aim should be to replace Syria\\'s rigid top-down system with participatory, negotiated power structures, accompanied by functional security and justice systems. The recent experience of governance in Kurdish-controlled areas and the short-lived but rich experiments of some of the local councils operating in opposition-held areas in 2011 and 2012 offer useful precedents. Given the likely reluctance of opposition groups to give up their weapons, even the fight against ISIS will probably involve a good deal of coordination among decentralized, cooperating forces.  Ammar Abdullah / REUTERSRebel fighters in Hama Province, October 2015.And as for which Syrian opposition groups should be included in a future governing coalition, the key test should be whether they have demonstrated a commitment to avoiding abuses among their own forces and holding accountable those who commit them. Most observers assume that the various member groups of the Free Syrian Army would participate in such a coalition and that Kurdish forces would at least cooperate with it. The largest force whose inclusion in a future coalition is uncertain is Ahrar al-Sham, an Islamist group that has been responsible for atrocities over the course of the war but has presented a more pragmatic faade after September 2014, when most of its leadership was killed in a bomb attack. Whether it can be part of the solution in Syria or is left to fend for itself should depend on a discernible and enduring change in its conduct. Members of both ISIS and the al Qaeda-affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra, meanwhile, would almost certainly be excluded because of their systematic atrocities and the threat they are believed to pose to Western interests. Indeed, a main point of a Syrian deal would be to produce a governing coalition that could fight more effectively against both these extremist groups, if nothing else by supplying more of the ground forces that have so far been in short supply.A PREREQUISITE FOR PEACEAchieving an accord along such lines depends on developing a level of trust among Syria\\'s many warring factions that is currently lacking. It is very difficult, after all, to shake hands with opponents who are killing one\\'s families and neighbors. That is why U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is wrong to prioritize a deal first and atrocities second. Ending the slaughter of civilians--a crime by all sides but, measured by the number of victims, one predominately committed by Syrian government forces--is not a byproduct of a deal but a prerequisite for one. As the principles for an accord are refined, negotiators should not treat the atrocities as a sideshow, as the Vienna declaration did. Instead, they should use their substantial collective influence to insist on an end to them now.  Ending the slaughter of civilians is not a byproduct of a deal, but a prerequisite for one. The UN Security Council has occasionally called for an end to atrocities in Syria. But it did little to enforce such demands, especially after Russia began its military operations in Syria at the end of September. Perhaps to avoid being seen as complicit in attacks on civilians, Moscow then pressured the Syrian government to disavow the use of indiscriminate weapons. Damascus reiterated the pledge in a November 9 letter to the UN. Human Rights Watch\\'s research in Syria, however, shows that the Assad government has not lived up to its promise. That must change, and the governments involved in the negotiations--particularly Russia and Iran, whose support Assad needs to survive--should insist that Assad\\'s atrocities cease. Ending atrocities would go a long way toward establishing the conditions that might make the Syrian talks succeed. ',\n",

       "  'text': 'This is not a particularly happy time in Algerian politics. In the past two decades, the Algerian public has faced two realities: a civil war that threatened to shatter the state from its core and then relative calm under President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. The president, now in his late 70s, has ruled the nation since 1999. Following the Arab Spring in 2010, Bouteflika promised reforms to the Algerian political system that have yet to fully materialize. Global oil prices have plummeted, and Algeria has had to balance its budget by introducing austerity measures. And now, the burden of unpopular economic policies and Bouteflika\\'s lingering health problems has led many to fear the return of political uncertainty.The next few years may test Algeria\\'s political health, but there are signs that the nation can weather a period of uncertainty. Most telling is that, where decades ago, Algerians demanded democracy, they now hope for continuity. In pursuit of this, the Algerian polity may tolerate pseudo-democratic theatrics--as with Bouteflika\\'s unprecedented re-election to his fourth term--as it spells certainty and stability.THE END OF RENTIER POLITICSAlgeria\\'s current situation thus threatens to erode two central pillars of its normalcy: Bouteflika and oil profits that have subsidized life for ordinary Algerians. The government\\'s recent moves within the economy, presidency, and army can be understood as an attempt to preserve these tenets of the Algerian social contract despite the significant challenges it faces in doing so.First, knowing that Algerian subsidy programs are unsustainable due to falling oil prices, the government is raising taxes and prices on fuel, electricity, automobiles, medicine, telecommunications, and transport gradually, hoping to soften the economic blow to average Algerians. Moreover, core subsidies like housing, education, and defense funding will remain untouched.Second, the government is approaching Bouteflika\\'s succession with an eye to continuity, and hopes to mitigate the risk of conflict around the appointment Algeria\\'s next leader. Few have faith that Bouteflika\\'s health will hold until Algerian elections that are scheduled for 2019. Bouteflika has been in and out of hospitals since 2005, including a major hospitalization in France in 2013, and things carried on as usual despite his absence. It stands to reason that the president\\'s coterie is already preparing a successor from within the regime as a placeholder for when the president can no longer remain in power. Every detail of this succession will likely be managed from within.Critically, a third pillar of state legitimacy--national security--has not wavered despite current troubles. Algeria\\'s powerful military-intelligence services are still central in maintaining the country\\'s security. Algeria\\'s murky high politics make it difficult to determine the exact relationship between the executive and the military, but recent trials and punishments against generals for corruption are steps toward improving the perception of military accountability and the perception of the civil state\\'s strength. These recent changes signal to the public that both centers of national power are invested in a managed civilian transition of power.  Louafi Larbi / ReutersPresident Abdelaziz Bouteflika arrives for a swearing-in ceremony in Algiers April 28, 2014.Notably absent in this managed change of hands will be a credible attempt to allow Algerians to participate in the process.In some countries, that might be cause for outrage. But Algerians, politically fatigued, are putting democracy on the backburner.It is easy to see why Algerians may not be clamoring for drastic political change. They remember Algeria\\'s political unrest of the 1990s, after the military cancelled an Islamist electoral victory, giving way to an armed insurgency that killed hundreds of thousands. And in more recent times, many saw echoes of Algeria\\'s past within the Arab Spring\\'s aftermath: Libya\\'s ongoing civil war has no end in sight. Tunisia, with its triumphs and Nobel Peace Prize-worthy efforts at birthing a democracy, has experienced unprecedented violence. In Syria, the stalled revolution has cost thousands their lives and has encouraged the spread of the Islamic State (also called ISIS). Democracy may seem a worthwhile endeavor intellectually, but stability seems a safer bet.  Of course, austerity could change that calculation. If the financial measures fail to land as softly as planned, Algerians may indeed take to the streets. But if they do so, it will not be for a pie-in-the-sky objective: not for free and fair elections, greater decentralization, nor greater parliamentary power. It will be for their livelihoods.In other words, although Algerian opposition parties warn of a repeat of the unrest seen throughout the 1990s and have called for democratic reforms, observers are skeptical. More likely is a continuation of the current system, in which opposition political parties are considered part of the theatrics: superficially challenging the deep state while being seen as largely co-opted. Meanwhile, the front these parties have formed--a coalition of Islamist, Berberist, Trotskyite parties, and regime defectors--offer few if any viable alternatives to Algeria\\'s political status quo, as they lack internal ideological alignment and have contradictory political goals.  Zohra Bensemra / ReutersA woman stands at the entrance of her door at the old city of Algiers Al Casbah, Algeria October 25, 2015.That few viable alternatives to the establishment exist undoubtedly contributes to Algeria\\'s wider political disillusionment. But for many, it also underscores the notion that political jockeying, democratization efforts, and reform movements are distractions from the more important need to address social and economic grievances. The idea that citizens prefer survival, stability, and comfort above democracy is not new, but the concept is still a hard one for U.S. sensibilities to stomach. And within Bouteflika\\'s Algeria, the widespread sense is \"mwalfa kheir men talfa,\" a rhyme in Algerian Arabic that more or less means, \"better the devil you know.\" Algerian society is lukewarm to the prospect of a managed succession, and is even less willing to believe that true multi-party democracy could flourish instead. The risks are far too high, and the rewards too unlikely. ',\n",

       "  'text': 'By the most recent forecast, the U.S. Federal Reserve is set to raise interet rates on December 16. That it\\'s happening in the midst of a global economic slowdown is bad news for markets and economies around the world. Even China\\'s yuan, which had remained stable alongside the strengthening U.S. dollar until recently, had to decouple from it in August to bolster the country\\'s faltering export industries; it was another decision that shook markets worldwide.Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has been warning of the coming interest rate hike for some time now. She wanted to sound the alarm sooner rather than later because the Fed has injected some $2.5 trillion in excess reserves--17.6 times more than the statutory reserves needed to support the present level of U.S. money supply and lending activity. When a central bank has created such an unprecedented degree of liquidity, particularly with the U.S. economy doing relatively well, inflation could accelerate much sooner than in the past once the private sector is ready to borrow money again. That could force the Fed into an abrupt tightening, which could be very damaging to the market and the economy. The Fed must also avoid creating the impression of being behind the curve on inflation lest it trigger a bond market crash that could send long-term interest rates rocketing.  Kevin Lamarque / ReutersU.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen testifies before the Senate Banking Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, July 15, 2014.In spite of the United States\\' relatively strong economy, inflation remained subdued because the private sector still maintained a financial surplus of over six percent of GDP, at least through the year ending in the third quarter of 2015, according to the flow of funds data. This is worrying because it means that the private sector continued to save in spite of zero interest rates, a disturbing trend that began when Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008. It also indicates that businesses and households are still recovering their balance sheets, which may have been hurt when the housing bubble burst in 2008. Their refusal to borrow means that the liquidity injected by the Fed remained with the financial institutions that received them and has not entered the real economy.The fact that the private sector as a whole is still saving money at zero interest rates is worrying because both Japan in 2000 and Europe in 2011 tried to raise rates under similar conditions but were ultimately forced to take them back to zero. In both cases, the economies turned out to be much weaker than some macro indicators had suggested.The Fed\\'s need to appear vigilant against inflation while facing a still weak global economy suggests that it should reverse the order of monetary policy normalization set forth in September 2014. At that time, it was decided to raise interest rates first before draining excess reserves because the market is more familiar with rate hikes, while a reserve-draining operation would be the first in history and might create unpredictable disruptions.Since the Fed\\'s September announcement, however, the dollar has skyrocketed and oil prices have collapsed. This means that inflation is likely to stay subdued, undermining the rationale behind rate hikes.  Toru Hanai / ReutersA man is reflected on an electronic board displaying exchange rates, August 11, 2010.Meanwhile, reserve-draining operations generally require the Fed to sell bonds. Although that would tend to push bond prices lower and yields higher, the Bank of Japan\\'s decision in October 2014 to expand its liquidity injections and the European Central Bank\\'s decision to do so earlier this year have pushed interest rates in many countries to zero or subzero levels. That move boosted Japanese and European investors\\' demand for higher-yielding dollar bonds.This means the Fed has the perfect opportunity right now to sell bonds to drain excess reserves--there is robust overseas demand for U.S. bonds, plenty of domestic savings (at least according to the flow of funds data) to absorb the bonds unloaded by the Fed, and a strong dollar and cheap oil keeping inflation concerns in check. These factors all suggest that any pressures that drive down bond prices and drive up bond yields from a reserve mop-up operation are likely to be modest.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-x90_2\");    });  In other words, the Fed should drain excess reserves first before raising interest rates. If bond yields do climb excessively because the Fed unloads the bonds, the Fed could always calm the markets by announcing an extension of the zero interest rate policy. When the market realizes that the Fed has this fallback option to keep short-term rates low, long-term interest rates (that is, bond yields) are not likely to go that much higher.  It is better to familiarize the market with this unprecedented mop-up of excess reserves now, when the external environment is ideal. That would mitigate the impact of any future economic shocks such as higher oil prices and a weaker dollar, because by then the market would be accustomed to mop-up operations. If the Fed is concerned about appearing behind the curve in countering inflation, draining excess reserves is also a valid and credible inflation countermeasure.In contrast, if the Fed has to begin reserve-draining operations when policy interest rates are already rising, domestic and foreign appetite for U.S. bonds are waning, and oil prices are rising, chances are high that bond yields will sky rocket, and that would have devastating consequences for the economy.Since the rate hike announcement over a year ago, the external conditions have changed drastically, providing the Fed with a golden opportunity to drain excess reserves.

       "  'text': 'By finally inviting Montenegro to join NATO, the treaty organization has taken a significant step toward ending Russian chicanery in this small but significant Balkan country. But it will have to act fast to secure its gains. If NATO fails to close the deal, Moscow will have an opening to further destabilize the region and undermine Western interests in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Macedonia, and Serbia.In principle, there is little reason to fear.Completing the process of membership requires that Montenegro iron out a few technical details regarding its accession and that the legislative branches of NATO members, including the U.S. Senate, approve the formal protocols.But all this takes time, and Montenegro faces elections in October. This creates a perfect opportunity for Russian subversion.The potential for Russian interference was evident in October, when Montenegrin protesters and police clashed during demonstrations against the country\\'s President, Milo Djukaonovic. Although officials in Moscow denied Djukanovic\\'s allegations that they orchestrated the protests--and clearly many protesters were demonstrating over corruption and the state of the economy--speculation about Moscow\\'s role mounted when the archbishop of the staunchly pro-Russia Serbian Orthodox Church publicly lamented Montenegro\\'s separation from \"Mother Russia.\" Meanwhile, in neighboring Bosnia, Russia has become openly partisan in favor of the separatist Serb leaders. The Russian ambassador there recently injected himself in a tense controversy over a highly provocative referendum that could put the country\\'s stability in jeopardy. The idea that Moscow would show restraint next door in Montenegro, with a chance to thwart the country\\'s NATO bid in the balance, is farfetched.   Stevo Vasiljevic / ReutersRiot police protect themselves with shields during clashes with protesters in front of the parliament building in Podgorica, Montenegro, October 2015.Moreover, Russia has the tools at its disposal to influence next October\\'s elections. In addition to the Serbian Orthodox Church and avowedly pro-Serb parties, there is residual anti-Americanism in Montenegro among leftists and green party activists. Elections in Montenegro can be competitive, with control of parliament sometimes decided by five seats or less. Dispensed liberally, Russian propaganda and money could animate the opposition, influence officials, and succeed in propelling anti-NATO, pro-Russia parties into power.Montenegro\\'s accession to NATO is particularly irksome to the Russians, since it would become the first Orthodox-majority country of the former Yugoslavia to join the alliance. Montenegro also has historic ties with Bosnia and Serbia; so, should its bid succeed, NATO membership for those two countries would become a plausible, if not an immediate prospect. Serbia\\'s nationalist leaders, surprisingly, have already voiced their backing for Montenegro\\'s NATO bid, a move that must have worried Moscow, which owns Serbia\\'s national oil company and envisions the Balkans as part of its energy domain.But Moscow\\'s outright opposition to NATO expansion is a recent posture. It was only after a NATO Summit at Cardiff in 2014 that Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov delivered the stinging pronouncement that Russia would see NATO expansion in the Balkans as a \"provocation.\" Prior to that, Russian President Vladimir Putin had personally informed Balkan leaders, including the President of Macedonia, another Orthodox majority country that he didn\\'t care if the country joined NATO. Montenegro itself, even after its bitter split from Serbia in 2006, enjoyed good relations with Moscow and attracted substantial investment from Russia despite its determined course to join NATO and the European Union. All of that changed when the Ukraine crisis erupted last year, forcing Balkan countries to choose whether or not to apply EU sanctions against Russia. While Serbia refrained from doing so, Montenegro followed Brussels\\' lead, incurring the wrath of Moscow, which suddenly saw the need to frustrate Western objectives in the Balkans.Montenegro\\'s accession to NATO is particularly irksome to the Russians, since it would become the first Orthodox-majority country of the former Yugoslavia to join the alliance.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-x90_2\");    });  For the United States, the benefits of bringing Montenegro into NATO clearly outweigh the risks of increased tensions with Russia. First, it would close the possibility of a Russian naval basing in the Adriatic, something that Moscow avidly sought last year. Second, it would anchor a country that was once firmly under the grips of former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic into Euro-Atlantic institutions. Third, it promises to spur EU enlargement in the Balkans, which has flagged in recent years. No former communist country has joined the European Union without first joining NATO, and EU accession is a central plank in Washington\\'s strategy to press Europe to confront its Balkan backyard.    Jonathan Ernst / ReutersJohn Kerry meets Montenegro\\'s Foreign Minister Igor Luksic at the NATO ministerial meetings at NATO Headquarters in Brussels, December 2015.Montenegro stands to benefit, too. The country has watched from the sidelines as tourism from the UnitedStates has soared in neighboring Croatia after Zagreb joined NATO in 2009. Montenegro, whose economy is based on tourism, could use the extra source of income. In addition, NATO membership would likely attract more foreign investment. And respect for democratic values among the country\\'s leaders may also grow as a result of joining an alliance dedicated to civilian control of the military.In short, the United States has ample reason to ensure that NATO membership for Montenegro becomes a reality--and to do so before Russia has a chance to skew the country\\'s election next fall. With the situation in Bosnia teetering, and with a heightened threat of Islamist radicalization in the region thanks to ISIS, closing the NATO deal with Montenegro is a stabilizing and feasible step to take while U.S. President Barack Obama remains in office. Election year politics in the U.S. Senate--with five senators running to succeed him--mean that the Obama administration will need to make the small country of Montenegro an outsized policy priority.

       "  'text': 'The EU is under siege. The arrival of hundreds of thousands of refugees from Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria has tested the single-border principle at the core of the union. The ongoing financial crisis in Greece has strained the single currency. The United Kingdom will soon hold a referendum on whether or not to exit the EU. The survival of an EU with a single border, a single currency, and a stable membership appears less likely than ever before.European federalists dismiss these problems as growing pains. The EU is an incredibly ambitious work in progress, they note, one that is rooted in a vision of Europe that challenges deep-seated notions of sovereignty and statehood. Surveying the destruction during World War II, Jean Monnet, considered by many to be a founding father of the EU, wrote, \"There will be no peace in Europe if the states are reconstituted on the basis of national sovereignty. . . . The countries of Europe are too small to guarantee their peoples the necessary prosperity and social development. The European states must constitute themselves into a federation.\" Monnet\\'s union would be built through cooperation and common markets and would ultimately resemble a \"United States of Europe,\" a phrase later embraced by Winston Churchill to describe his own vision of Europe\\'s best possible future. The question is whether that vision can withstand the blows that have rained down on the EU since the financial crisis began in 2008.When the euro was adopted, in 1999, many voiced concerns that the monetary union would prevent countries from responding properly to financial crises because they were forfeiting the ability to devalue their currencies, which most economists contend is the best response to such situations. But the political logic of binding the continent together through a common currency trumped the doubts. Supporters of the single currency argued that crises could be averted through adherence to a set of rules (the Maastricht rules) that prevented countries from accumulating too much debt.The euro supporters\\' view took a major hit in 2008, when the financial crisis spread from the United States to Europe. In October 2009, George Papandreou became Greece\\'s prime minister and discovered that his country had vastly underreported its debt levels. Greece\\'s creditors, particularly French and German banks, were overexposed. The EU called in the International Monetary Fund, fearing that the crisis would spread. It did, and soon Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain were all affected. Negotiations between each government and the so-called troika--the European Central Bank, the European Commission, and the IMF--resulted in EU-IMF programs in Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain.  John Kolesidis / ReutersA protester extends his fingers in a traditional gesture of insult during a rally against a new austerity package in Athens, May 2011.The EU response, and the showdowns it has produced in the subsequent years, has been interpreted by observers in two ways. One view holds that the crisis has drawn Europe closer together. This is what the political scientist Kathleen McNamara argues in her thoughtful new book, The Politics of Everyday Europe. Despite a fraying sense of European solidarity, she writes, EU member states committed roughly one trillion euros to keep the currency afloat and the eurozone\\'s member states financially stable. The EU has also inaugurated new institutions designed to help the member states respond to crises: the European Stability Mechanism; a new fiscal compact; and a European banking union, currently under construction. The power of the European Central Bank has increased, she writes, making it \"the most effective and active actor in the Eurozone crisis,\" and European leaders have met more and more frequently in summits \"too numerous to count.\"A less sanguine interpretation of the crisis is that the EU, far from being drawn together, has been split down the middle. Southern European countries, including Greece, Italy, and Spain, blame the EU for punitive austerity measures that have left millions out of work. Meanwhile, northern countries, such as Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, complain that the EU has not been strict enough with highly indebted member states; some officials in those countries, including German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schuble, have openly called on Greece to exit the monetary union. (The refugee crisis has precipitated a similar split, as southern and eastern states have shouldered the bulk of the burden, breeding resentment toward their northern and western neighbors.)At this point, it requires a great deal of optimism to interpret the EU\\'s response to the eurozone crisis as proof that the union\\'s institutions can steer Europe toward more integration. More likely is the prospect of a more fractious, divided union, drifting away from the vision of its founders and champions.A LESS PERFECT UNIONMcNamara views the EU\\'s response to the financial crisis as evidence of the union\\'s successful integration. Such a response would have been impossible, McNamara writes, were it not for \"decades of slow accumulation of everyday symbols and practices\" that \"created a permissive consensus for such political developments.\" These \"symbols and practices\" include not just the single currency and the absence of border controls but also \"European\" buildings and spectacles, a common market in European soccer players, a shared statistics agency (Eurostat), and a European diplomatic corps. Put simply, the quiet introduction of European \"labels, mental maps, and narratives\" has built a European way of interpreting the world.The next phase in creating a federated Europe will not be easy, McNamara concedes. She argues that it will require greater democratic representation, more citizen participation, and a higher quality of debate. \"The EU needs more overt contestation and direct discussion of its policies, and debate over its leaders,\" McNamara writes.Optimistically, McNamara sees such change happening already. As evidence, she points to the most recent election of the European Commission president and to the 2014 EU parliamentary elections, which she describes as \"much more publicly contested than any before in EU history,\" noting that they received \"wide coverage in national newspapers\" and that \"various trans-European interest groups--from students to environmental activists to high-priced consultants\"--sought to mobilize EU-wide constituencies.The 2014 EU parliamentary elections may well have been \"more publicly contested,\" as McNamara argues, but the results swept an extraordinary number of anti-EU and anti-euro parties into power. In France, the right-wing National Front won the largest share of the vote; in the United Kingdom, that distinction went to the anti-EU UK Independence Party. In the Netherlands, the Party for Freedom, which has advocated withdrawal from the EU, won more than 13 percent of the votes (it had won an even greater percentage in 2009). In Greece, the neo-Nazi party Golden Dawn won just over nine percent of the votes.It requires a great deal of optimism to interpret the EU\\'s response to the eurozone crisis as proof that the union\\'s institutions can steer Europe toward more integration.In light of severe government cutbacks across Europe, such results are not surprising. In the wake of the 2008 crisis, austerity has meant fewer jobs, smaller pensions, less affordable health care, tighter school budgets, and cutbacks to local services. People are feeling the pinch, and they are afraid. Meanwhile, support for populist and nationalist parties has risen, and support for the EU has declined. Between 2007 and 2013, the Pew Research Center reports, the EU\\'s favorability rating fell by 34 percentage points in Spain, 21 points in France, and 20 points in Italy. As McNamara notes, \"The close identification of [austerity] policies with \\'Europe\\' is an association that is piercing the banal authority the EU has been built on, and creating new challenges for legitimation.\"Public opinion toward the EU has improved recently, but not much, with the median figure for EU favorability rising from 46 percent in 2013 to 52 percent in 2014. Eurobarometer, a series of public opinion surveys conducted by the European Commission, has shown slight increases in the percentage of Europeans who say they have a positive image of the EU (41 percent in May 2015, up from 39 percent in November 2014), trust the EU (40 percent, up from 37 percent), and feel that their voice counts in the EU (42 percent, up from 40 percent).It\\'s unclear, however, whether this trend has much to do with the new institutions the EU created in the wake of the crisis and which McNamara hails. Once the crisis erupted, it became clear that the EU\\'s rules on debt management were not being enforced, that its banking regulations were inadequate and ill equipped to deal with cross-border issues, and that the EU had no centralized fiscal capacity to bail out a member state. Still, the eurozone\\'s members held together, aware that the cost of a Greek exit would be greater than the cost of a bailout. In 2012, they signed a treaty creating the European Stability Mechanism, which comes with an emergency lending capacity of 500 billion euros. To borrow from the new fund, countries must submit an outline of their economic programs for approval by the troika and ratify the new fiscal compact, a strict set of rules designed to prevent countries from going into debt--in part by threatening economic sanctions against those that do not comply. EU leaders have also committed to a new banking union.  Bertrand Langlois / ReutersFrancois Hollande (L) and Angela Merkel (R) attend a bilateral meeting ahead of an EU summit on the union\\'s long-term budget in Brussels, November 2012.The new institutions may sound promising, but the details reveal significant weaknesses. Germany remains terrified of any initiative that involves sharing liabilities. And so the banking union has no common deposit insurance, no simple resolution process for failing financial institutions, and no single backstop with which to bail out banks. The fiscal compact is simply another version of the Stability and Growth Pact, introduced in 1999, which failed when France and Germany did not abide by it. There is little to suggest that this time around will be any more successful. And the European Stability Mechanism, for its part, is less a sign of European integration than of continued German dominance. It will raise 500 billion euros by selling bonds that will enjoy creditworthiness only because, to quote the credit-rating agency Moody\\'s, they are \"closely correlated\" with key shareholders. Put simply, the markets assume that the European Stability Mechanism will reflect Germany\\'s intentions, and the eurozone governments know that there will be negative repercussions at any hint that Germany disapproves of a loan.THE FUTURE OF EUROPEThe EU has survived the crises of the past few years so far, but it seems unlikely to cohere any further into a tightly bound superstate. Three other possibilities seem more likely. The rise of localism, regionalism, and even separatism--witness the renewed strength of Scottish nationalists and Catalan separatists--suggests that many Europeans yearn for more self-determination. One way the EU could respond is by accommodating, rather than blocking, the emergence of small independent nations that might see closer ties with Brussels as a form of freedom from overbearing national capitals. Such a future would certainly fit within McNamara\\'s vision of a more politically active, participatory Europe.This possibility was derided after the interwar years as a recipe for conflict and instability. Indeed, it was to defend Europe from the threat of various nationalisms and regionalisms that Monnet developed his concept of a European federation. In reality, however, the growth of the EU has gone hand in hand with demands for autonomy within it. Indeed, the EU has itself made such demands plausible: Scots would likely find the idea of secession from the United Kingdom far less attractive if there were no EU for an independent Scotland to join. The problem for the EU is that if it were to accept Scotland as a member, the Basques, the Catalans, and others would soon line up to be next, opening the floodgates to secessionism. This is not something major powers in the EU will permit.The EU, far from being drawn together, has been split down the middle. A second possible future would see the reinforcing of Germany\\'s de facto hegemony within the EU. France and Italy are declining in influence and economic power, and the United Kingdom is not a eurozone member, so Germany has become ever more powerful as the core of the EU. This observation is curiously absent from McNamara\\'s book. German leadership is driving European integration forward, providing the resources to ensure that the EU succeeds, even as the resolve of other member states weakens. Yet for many states, the eurozone crisis underscored the threat of unchecked German influence. As Bill Cash, the chair of the British Parliament\\'s European Scrutiny Committee, put it recently, \"The European Union has morphed into an increasingly undemocratic German-dominated Europe.\" As a result, countries have become less interested in a European federation, even as they continue to follow EU rules and regulations. And poorer, smaller nations understandably fear a union whose stability would depend on a German chancellor\\'s self-restraint.A third future for Europe hinges on the continent\\'s changing demographics. Crucially, Europe\\'s low birthrates and aging populations have created a need for immigrant labor. In 2014, the Organ-ization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the European Commission reported that Europe\\'s working-age population is projected to decline by 7.5 million between 2013 and 2020, and in a scenario of zero net immigration, it could decline by up to 11.7 million. The continent is suffering from a shortage of skilled labor just as it needs most to compete globally for talent. Meanwhile, Europe has been flooded by what the OECD calls \"an unprecedented number of asylum seekers and refugees,\" which includes 350,000 to 450,000 people who \"could be granted refugee or similar status, more than in any previous European refugee crisis since World War II.\"Europe is quickly becoming one of the most diverse regions of the world. Germany now has the third-highest number of immigrants of any country, according to the United Nations, and more than 16 million of its 81 million people are of foreign or immigrant descent. The United Kingdom has the second-highest number of immigrants in the EU after Germany. As these and other European economies continue to grow, so, too, will their demand for foreign workers. Put another way, Europe will become more like the United States, since immigration will be unstoppable (geopolitically) and necessary (demographically and economically). This might make further European integration easier as old national identities become ever more porous. Countries looking for social cohesion may well turn to a broader European identity, one tied together by the \"labels, mental maps, and narratives\" McNamara describes. In the short term, however, it is precisely this prospect that fuels opposition to both immigration and further European integration.The most likely future of the EU is ongoing cooperation under German leadership. Whether this is to be feared will depend largely on domestic politics within Germany, as well as on the willingness of Europe\\'s larger players to keep Germany focused on (and constrained by) the mutual benefits of the union. In the longer term, politics within Germany (and all the other European nations) will shift as its population changes. A more diverse Europe will alter the politics within each country and may ultimately make the case for greater integration easier.The idea of European federation promised peace within Europe\\'s borders and global influence beyond them. But Europe is not on the path toward that future. The eurozone crisis has cracked the foundations of European integration. European countries have successfully cooperated over the past six decades and are likely to continue to do so, under an umbrella of Germany hegemony. Paradoxically, ever-strengthening German leadership simultaneously facilitates cooperation and repels further integration. The result will be a Europe that continues to use, but does not fully exploit, its collective political and economic weight in the world. blank',\n",

       "  'text': 'At the end of September, Russia began conducting air strikes in Syria, ostensibly to combat terrorist groups. The strikes constitute Russia\\'s biggest intervention in the Middle East in decades. Its unanticipated military foray into Syria has transformed the civil war there into a proxy U.S.-Russian conflict and has raised the stakes in the ongoing standoff between Moscow and Washington. It has also succeeded in diverting attention away from Russia\\'s destabilization of Ukraine, making it impossible for the West to continue to isolate the Kremlin. Russia is now a player in the Syrian crisis, and the United States will have to find a way to deal with it.Once again, Washington has been caught off-guard, just as it was in March 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and began supporting pro-Russian separatists fighting Ukrainian forces in eastern Ukraine. For all of Russia\\'s domestic problems--a shrinking economy, a declining population, and high rates of capital flight and brain drain--it has projected a surprising amount of power not only in its neighborhood but also beyond. U.S. President Barack Obama may refer to Russia as a regional power, but Russia\\'s military intervention in Syria demonstrates that it once again intends to be accepted as a global actor and play a part in every major international decision. This will be a vexing challenge not only for Obama during his remaining time in office but also for the next occupant of the White House.Why has Washington been so slow to grasp the new Russian reality? Russian President Vladimir Putin has not kept his agenda a secret. In February 2007, for example, he delivered a scathing critique of U.S. foreign policy at the Munich Security Conference. \"One state and, of course, first and foremost the United States, has overstepped its national borders in every way,\" he warned. Countless times since, Russia has vowed to replace what it sees as a coercive U.S.-led global order with one in which the West respects Russia\\'s interests. In retrospect, Russia\\'s war with Georgia in August 2008 signaled Moscow\\'s willingness to use force to prevent its neighbors from drifting toward the West and to reassert its influence in areas that were formerly part of the Soviet Union. But the United States and its allies have repeatedly underestimated Russia\\'s determination to revise the global order that Moscow feels the West has imposed on Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union.As the United States gears up for the 2016 presidential election, it faces two central challenges in deciding how to deal with Russia. First, it needs to determine the nature of Russia\\'s objectives in Syria and Ukraine. Second, because Russia depends on a highly personalized political system, Obama and his would-be successors need to decide how to manage relations with Putin, an especially difficult task given the overwhelming pressure on the campaign trail to look tough. The evidence suggests that if the next president wants to engage with the Kremlin in a way that is consistent with U.S. interests, he or she should focus on concrete areas where the two countries can and must work together--particularly nuclear and conventional military issues. Continuing to isolate Russia is not likely to work. Instead, the next U.S. administration should clearly communicate to the Kremlin what American interests and values are and join with U.S. allies in resisting further Russian attempts to unravel the post-Cold War order.INFERIORITY COMPLEXOver the past quarter century, Moscow and Washington have worked together most successfully when Moscow has felt that it has been treated as an equal. This explains the success, for example, of U.S.-Russian arms control treaties, such as New START, which were designed to deal with the nuclear legacy of the Cold War. Similarly, although the negotiations were arduous and drawn out, Russia and the United States successfully worked together, alongside four other world powers, to reach a nuclear deal with Iran. Indeed, Putin earned rare praise from Obama for his role in securing the agreement.The United States has been unable to create a post-Cold War security architecture in which Russia feels it has a stake.Moscow and Washington have also been able to work together in instances in which they shared narrowly defined common interests. In the fall of 2001, for example, Russia aided the United States in its initial military campaign in Afghanistan, providing information and intelligence that contributed to the U.S. defeat of the Taliban. As Russia\\'s former foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, subsequently explained, \"We wanted an antiterrorist international coalition like the anti-Nazi coalition. This would be the basis for a new world order.\"    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(\"dfp-ad-x90_2\");    });  That rather lofty goal has remained predictably out of reach. And in fact, Russia and the United States have had difficulty maintaining their counterterrorist cooperation, largely because they often disagree on which groups to designate as terrorist organizations--a problem that has cropped up most recently in regard to the various Syrian opposition groups. Nevertheless, Russia and the United States have been able to cooperate on other security issues, working together in 2013, for example, to eliminate the Assad regime\\'s stockpile of chemical weapons. In that instance, Russia took the initiative after the United States proved reluctant to act.Cooperation has been least successful on issues involving Russia\\'s neighboring states and the NATO alliance. It has become clear that despite the West\\'s numerous efforts in the 1990s to reassure Russia that an enlarged NATO would not represent a threat to Moscow, the United States and its allies have been unable to create a post-Cold War security architecture in which Russia feels that it has a stake. Perhaps doing so would have been impossible, especially given Russia\\'s belief in its right to a sphere of \"privileged interests\" in the post-Soviet space and its desire to limit its neighbors\\' sovereignty. The wars in Georgia and Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea have represented, in part, Russia\\'s answer to its perceived exclusion from the post-Cold War European security order. The same sense of grievance explains Putin\\'s ongoing push to establish a new arrangement among the great powers that would give Russia more leverage on matters of European security. Specifically, Putin seeks an agreement that would ensure that no additional post-Soviet states will join NATO.PUTIN\\'S BIG MOVEPutin\\'s decision to intervene militarily in Syria is rooted in similar concerns about Russian power and influence. Russia has justified its foray into Syria as part of an effort to reduce terrorism by shoring up the Assad regime, which by the summer of 2015 was facing military setbacks. As Putin said in October, \"The collapse of Syria\\'s official authorities will only mobilize terrorists. Right now, instead of undermining them, we must revive them, strengthening state institutions in the conflict zone.\" Although Moscow may not be wedded to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the long run, it is adamantly opposed to anything that would weaken the rule of secular strongmen in the Middle East--hence Putin\\'s repeated denunciations of U.S. support for opposition forces during the Arab revolts of 2011 and his anger over the NATO military action against Libya that year, which led to the ouster of Libyan dictator Muammar al-Qaddafi. In Putin\\'s eyes, the disorder in Iraq, Syria, and North Africa, combined with the rise of the self-proclaimed Islamic State (also known as ISIS), demonstrates the failure of the West to think through the consequences of undermining the authoritarian states in the region. Putin fears that chaos in the Middle East will strengthen Islamic extremism on Russia\\'s borders, in the neighboring states of the former Soviet Union, and potentially in Russia itself.  Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation / Handout via ReutersA frame grab taken from footage released by Russia\\'s Defence Ministry shows air strikes carried out by Russia\\'s air force in Syria, November 2015.At the same time, Russia\\'s actions are designed to guarantee that Moscow will have a decisive say in who rules Syria, even in a hypothetical post-Assad future. By using military force in Syria, Moscow is sending a message to other regional players: unlike the United States, Russia will support leaders and governments against popular uprisings and will not desert them when opposition groups attempt to seize control, as the United States abandoned Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in 2011.The Syrian gambit is thus part of a broader move to recoup Russian influence in the Middle East. In the second half of 2015, the leaders of Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates all visited Moscow, and some have signed agreements to purchase arms from Russia. In July, Saudi Arabia pledged to invest up to $10 billion in Russia, mostly in agricultural projects; if Riyadh delivers on that promise, it will be the single largest foreign investment in the country. Israel and Russia have maintained a steady dialogue as the crisis has progressed in Syria, partly to ensure that Russian aircraft don\\'t clash with the Israeli jets that have occasionally struck targets in Syria, including those associated with the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah, which has sent thousands of fighters to Syria to aid the Assad regime. Although the Israelis have no particular affection for Assad, they seem to share Russia\\'s preference that his regime stay in place, because what comes after Assad could be more detrimental to Israel\\'s security: Israeli officials have quietly pointed out that under Assad\\'s rule, Israel\\'s border with Syria has been calm.Domestic political factors also contribute to Putin\\'s calculations. The sanctions that the United States and the EU levied against Russia after its annexation of Crimea have hit hard, especially when combined with the global fall in oil prices and preexisting structural problems in the Russian economy. The Kremlin has sought relief by \"freezing\" the conflict in the Donbas region of Ukraine--a cease-fire between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists has been in force since early September, and both sides have pulled back some of their heavy weaponry, although sporadic reports of fighting have surfaced since then. Putin has calculated that the cease-fire and the decision by pro-Russian separatists to postpone local elections in eastern Ukraine may lead to the partial lifting of EU sanctions. Moreover, by making the Ukraine crisis appear to be headed toward resolution, Russia intends to shift the focus from its role as an instigator of conflict to its new role in Syria as a responsible leader in the global campaign against terrorism.Russia has presented its intervention in Syria as a counterterrorist operation that will reduce the number of refugees leaving Syria for Europe. But Moscow\\'s policy could have the opposite effect. In fact, by November, there had already been a 26 percent increase in the number of Syrian refugees, according to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, further exacerbating Europe\\'s migrant crisis. The Russian bombing campaign may have contributed to the upsurge in refugees. Moreover, Russian air strikes in support of the Alawite-led Assad government--which Sunni extremists consider to be an apostate regime--may both encourage more Russians to join ISIS (more than 4,000 people from Russia and Central Asia have already done so) and further alienate Russia\\'s own Sunni population, which numbers about 20 million. Putin has insisted that Russia has no interest in taking sides in a sectarian dispute and is merely fighting extremism, but this may be a hard sell domestically, as some Russian Muslims question Russia\\'s support of a regime that bombs its Sunni population. And Russia has not acknowledged that the Assad regime\\'s brutal treatment of its own population is a recruiting tool for ISIS.Although it is tempting to search for a broader strategy behind Russian military activity in Syria, it\\'s quite possible that Putin charged into the conflict without thinking through the endgame.Putin\\'s intervention in Syria has sent a mixed message. On the one hand, he has blamed the United States for creating the conditions that allowed ISIS to emerge; on the other, he has offered to join the United States in an anti-ISIS coalition. In remarks last October, Putin said, \"Syria can become a model for partnership in the name of common interests, resolving problems that affect everyone, and developing an effective risk-management system.\" Yet unlike in Afghanistan in 2001, Moscow and Washington do not agree on the identity of the enemy. Although they both see ISIS as a major threat, Russia has bombed Syrian opposition groups that the United States has supported, and Washington sees Assad\\'s rule as a major part of the country\\'s problems. Thanks to these differences, it will be difficult for Russia and the United States to work together in Syria.Until recently, Washington\\'s preferred policy was to avoid clashes in Syrian airspace, cautiously increase the presence of the U.S. military on the ground, observe Russian actions from the sidelines, and wait to see whether Russia would get pulled into a quagmire. But the November 13 terrorist attacks in Paris may have changed Washington\\'s calculations and given new impetus to joint U.S.-Russian efforts to deal with Syria and ISIS. At the G-20 summit in Turkey soon after the attacks, Obama and Putin agreed to support a cease-fire in Syria and intensify diplomatic attempts to end the civil war. At the very least, Putin has succeeded in getting Washington to engage more closely with Russia and abandon policies aimed at isolating it.If part of Putin\\'s main goal in Syria is to force Washington to recognize Russia\\'s importance in the Middle East, it is worth asking whether Putin sees that recognition as an end in itself or as an initial step toward a tripolar world in which China, Russia, and the United States make the major decisions--a cherished aspiration of some Russian pundits. On the other hand, although it is tempting to search for a broader strategy behind Russian military activity in Syria, it\\'s quite possible that Putin charged into the conflict without thinking through the endgame.GETTING REAL ABOUT RUSSIAFor the remainder of Obama\\'s second term, tensions over Syria and Ukraine will dominate U.S.-Russian relations. The best that can be achieved in Ukraine in the near term is a \"frozen conflict\" in which the cease-fire holds even though Kiev remains unable to control the Donbas region and Russia continues to exercise influence there through its proxies. The most the United States is likely to do is continue its modest economic and political support for the Ukrainian government, which is struggling to address systemic problems of corruption and economic disorder. Although some in the U.S. government have argued for more economic and military assistance to Ukraine--including the provision of lethal defensive weapons--the White House has consistently refused to do this for fear of further provoking Russia, and it is unlikely to change its policy in 2016.Meanwhile, it will be a continuing challenge for Moscow and Washington to work together in Syria to combat ISIS. But short of more robust and direct U.S. military engagement--for which there is little domestic support after the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq--Washington has limited options. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has spearheaded discussions with Russia and other key players, including Iran and Saudi Arabia, on how to end the Syrian civil war and transition away from an Assad-led government. Russia and the United States will continue to work together in this way, but securing agreement on a post-Assad Syria will be a major challenge. Direct military cooperation in Syria is highly unlikely, meaning that there are few prospects for Russia and the United States to work together other than on making sure their respective military operations stay out of the other\\'s way.  Lucy Nicholson / ReutersSyrian-Americans protest Russian intervention in Syria outside a Russian consular office in Santa Monica, California, October 2015.Even if the United States finds an effective way to respond to Russia\\'s moves in Syria, or even cooperate with the Russians there, there is no guarantee that Putin won\\'t try to assert Russia\\'s military presence elsewhere: he has surprised the West twice in recent years and may yet have other ambitions. Iraq has hinted that it may ask Russia for help in fighting ISIS. When asked in October about whether Russia would intervene in Iraq, Putin replied that Russia had not yet received a request from Baghdad. Russia has also indicated that it will not stand by if the situation in Afghanistan deteriorates further, as this would threaten Russia\\'s neighborhood by destabilizing Central Asia.  The next occupant of the White House will have to define U.S. interests in Syria and Ukraine; determine the extent to which Washington should counter destabilizing Russian moves in those countries and elsewhere; decide when and where the United States should cooperate with Russia; and consider, as U.S. options become more limited because of shrinking resources and public opinion, whether the West is ready to acknowledge that Moscow has in fact succeeded in modifying the rules of the game in its favor in both Syria and Ukraine.Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, four U.S. presidents have tried to \"reset\" relations with Russia and find a more productive way to interact with Moscow, and each attempt has ultimately failed. Russia has not evolved in the way the West believed it would in the 1990s: the United States has to deal with the Russia that exists, not the one Americans might wish for. Indeed, for the foreseeable future, Washington should expect the U.S.-Russian relationship to be defined by tension and antagonism rather than cooperation.The next U.S. president should not attempt another reset. He or she should work with Russia on issues on which Moscow and Washington share clearly delineated common goals, in Syria and elsewhere. Issues the two countries can work on together include keeping nuclear weapons from Iran and North Korea and managing emerging resource and security issues in the Arctic. But the next president should also clearly define and defend U.S. interests and accept that so long as the Kremlin continues to portray the United States as its main enemy, dedicated to weakening Russia and the primary source of all its troubles, common action on shared goals will be shaky and elusive.

       "  'text': 'Since its founding at the end of World War I, the League of Nations has stood at the center of clashing narratives about the twentieth century. For liberals, the League embodies the noble yet unfulfilled vision of Wilsonian internationalism. Realists see its failure as a testament to the durability of power politics. Revisionist historians interpret the League as an institutional tool used by European powers to reconstruct and legitimate their empires. In this major new study, Pedersen portrays the League as an awkward and conflicted undertaking that nonetheless put in motion the decline of imperialism and the spread of national self-determination. Pedersen focuses on the League\\'s Permanent Mandates Commission, the system established in 1921 to manage the territories in Africa, the Middle East, and the Pacific that Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire lost in the war. Many saw the mandate system as a ploy to strengthen British imperial rule. But, as Pedersen writes, the League machinery unexpectedly provided a \"platform\" for internationalists, humanitarians, nationalists, and others who sought to expose the brutality of imperial rule. It would take decades and another world war to bring about a global system of sovereign independent states. But the League pointed the way. blank',\n",

       "  'text': 'In one of the most riveting and heartfelt books to appear in some time, Coates reflects on the state of black America in the form of a letter to his adolescent son. For Coates, the American dream is so grounded in racism that the \"people who need to believe they are white\" today are almost as deeply involved in the destruction of black bodies and black lives as their forebears were. Coates\\' writing is powered by his outrage at the recent string of police shootings of young black men, which have gone largely unpunished, and intensified by his visceral fear for the safety of his own son in a country where such incidents are widespread. The book achieves a level of clarity and eloquence reminiscent of Ralph Ellison\\'s classic Invisible Man; it is compelling even when it isn\\'t entirely convincing. Coates may be a better polemicist than analyst, but the perspective he brings to American life is one that no responsible citizen or serious scholar can safely ignore. blank',\n",
