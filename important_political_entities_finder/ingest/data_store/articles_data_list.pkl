S'For the first time in six years, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization announced that it would expand its membership, inviting Montenegro to join the alliance. Only 16 years ago, NATO was bombing the small western Balkan nation as part of its intervention in Kosovo.With a standing military of only 2,000, Montenegro\'s membership will have little impact on the alliance\'s military strength. But the move has profound political consequences. It illustrates the progress that the western Balkans, and Montenegro in particular, have made since the bloody and traumatizing wars of the 1990s. To receive the invitation, Montenegro had to undertake a series of political, legal, and military reforms under the auspices of NATO\'s Membership Action Plan, a program that offers assistance and support for countries seeking to join the alliance. That a newly independent country could reach these standards in such a short time frame speaks to the enduring and powerful draw of the Euro-Atlantic community. In that sense, this remarkable success story comes at an opportune time--it is a bright spot in Europe\'s otherwise dark political terrain of internal strain, the refugee crisis, and the war in Ukraine.  Hazir Reka / ReutersProtesters flee from tear gas in the center of Kosovo\'s capital Pristina, November 18, 2015. Police and protesters clashed in Kosovo for a second day on Wednesday in a deepening crisis over relations with former ruler Serbia.Montenegro\'s membership also represents a major step toward consolidating political stability and democracy in the western Balkans; the reforms it undertook to reach this point include strengthening its governing structures and democratic institutions, as well as bringing its military up to NATO standards. NATO membership would also turn Montenegro into a regional leader and an example of how a small country, not even a decade old, can make great strides so long as it has enough political ambition. The move could inspire others, such as Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, to reenergize necessary reforms for eventual membership, a process that has stagnated in both countries. Montenegro\'s invitation would also send a signal to Georgia and Ukraine that NATO is, in fact, honoring its "open door policy," which was questioned in the face of Russia\'s annexation of Crimea.Russia is staunchly opposed to NATO expansion due to its deep-seated and historical fear of being "encircled" by a potential adversary. Within Russia, President Vladimir Putin inflates the threat of NATO as the country\'s top geopolitical foe in order to stoke Cold War-era tensions and consolidate domestic power. This makes curbing NATO expansion a strategic priority for Russia. Unsurprisingly, Russia quickly denounced NATO\'s invitation to Montenegro, which gained independence from Russia\'s natural ally in the region, Serbia, only nine years ago. Russia\'s Foreign Ministry called the decision "an openly confrontational step fraught with additional destabilizing consequences for the system of Euro-Atlantic security" and Dmitry Peskov, President Vladimir Putin\'s spokesman, said that NATO\'s expansion "cannot but result in retaliatory actions ... from the Russian side."Such warnings are likely rhetorical. Montenegro is more geographically insulated from Russia than Georgia or Ukraine. It\'s more likely that Russia will retaliate through political or economic channels instead. Already, pro-Russian groups in Montenegro have taken to the streets to protest against NATO membership and have also called for the resignation of Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic. Russia may stoke further civil unrest in order to make the country appear too unstable to join NATO. That may not be difficult to do. Domestically, Montenegro faces anti-NATO factions including from within both the Orthodox Church and political parties that emphasize ties to Serbia and Russia over NATO.Russia also has substantial economic leverage over the country, particularly in the tourism and real estate industries (an estimated 40 percent of Montenegrin real estate is Russian-owned); thus, Moscow, which placed a food embargo on Montenegro after it sided with the West on Ukraine, could slap on more sanctions in order to further punish the country for its Western-leaning political ambitions.  Marko Djurica / ReutersKosovo Serb boys stand on the street during a protest, October 17, 2011.Domestically, Montenegro\'s public is skeptical that NATO membership will be economically beneficial and is wary of the current government\'s motives, since Djukanovic, the very man who has steered his country toward NATO inclusion, has been charged with financial corruption. An investigation by the BBC in 2012 found that he and his associates were using a partially public-funded bank for their own personal use.When the 28 NATO members vote on Montenegro\'s membership in the coming year, Russia can fund anti-NATO political parties in countries more susceptible to Russian money, such as Hungary, Greece, or the Czech Republic, to vote, "no." In the past, NATO members\' parliaments have always deferred to their government\'s decision on NATO enlargement, but since the decision requires unanimous consensus among all 28 members, Russian influence remains a risk. The most likely scenario, however, is that Russia will look to prevent Serbia from following Montenegro\'s path. In recent years, Russia has worked to consolidate influence in Serbia and Republika Srpska, the ethnically Serb entity in Bosnia and Herzegovina, through economic aid and military cooperation.The EU opened accession talks with Serbia in the wake of the announcement about Montenegro\'s NATO membership. This demonstrated a rare example of coordination between NATO and the EU, two institutions that struggle to work together because of political divisions between two of its members, Turkey and Cyprus. But this move also opens new avenues for Russia to derail progress in the Balkans, either through Serbia\'s EU accession talks or through the fragile Serbia-Kosovo peace deal that the EU brokered in 2013.Crises in the Middle East and Ukraine have pushed the Balkans down on the priority list for many transatlantic leaders. But it is time to pay attention to the region again. Its relative calm and peace should not be taken for granted. Economic distress and the refugee and migrant crisis have stretched the Balkans\' fledgling democracies to their limits and opened new avenues for Russian interference. Bosnia risks backsliding into political turmoil, and Macedonia\'s ambitious political and democratic reforms suffered a monumental setback this summer after a scandal over the government\'s wiretaps of opposition leaders and ethnic violence in the Kumanovo region. Even the watershed Serbia-Kosovo peace deal hangs by a thread today; Kosovo erupted in protests last month after the government made a deal with Serbia to integrate Serb-majority regions in Kosovo--a move supported by Brussels. These are manifestations of deep-seated and unresolved political, ethnic, and economic stresses that are bubbling beneath the surface of ostensible progress toward European integration. That is why Montenegro\'s NATO membership invitation, although a major milestone, does not mean that peace in the region is a foregone conclusion. '

S'In Turkey, where there has been a rise in Islamic religiosity, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, founder of the pro-Islamist Development and Justice Party (AKP), is converting some public schools into seminaries called imam-hatips (or traditional training schools for Sunni Muslim clergy) in an effort to raise a generation of "religious youth."Students who perform poorly on entrance exams for secondary school are shunted into imam-hatips where they study the Koran for up to 13 hours a week and take courses on the life of the Prophet Muhammad and Arabic. Erdogan has boasted that during his tenure as president, enrollment in these schools soared from 63,000 to over one million. The number of imam-hatips increased by 73 percent between 2010 and 2014 and 13percent of Turkish students now study at such schools.Outraged, dozens of Turkish parents in Istanbul created an advocacy group called HandsOff My School to fight against Erdogan\'s education policy. In June of 2014, when the government tried to convert the local middle school to an imam-hatip, the group circulated a petition that quickly collected 13,000 signatures from other parents. A young lawyer from the neighborhood, Yasemin Zeytinoglu, even filed an emergency suspension with the Istanbul Administrative Court to halt the conversion.  Government officials eventually dropped the order to convert the school, giving the parents a short-lived victory. But the school stopped taking new students and after the current classes graduate, it will reopen as an extracurricular center. Left with no choice but to enroll their children in a different middle school, some parents told us that they felt the government was punishing them for protesting.In September, at the start of the 2014 school year, the members of Hands Off learned that 40,000 children were registered at imam-hatips without parental permission, including the grandson of Turkey\'s Chief Rabbi, Ishak Haleva. Hands Off, along with the tens of thousands of people from the secular teachers\' union and from religious minority groups, rallied forcefully in response. During one nationwide demonstration in February, the government responded by locking students inside their schools and calling the police to fire water cannons on protestors.In Gongoren, a working class borough of Istanbul where three middle schools were recently converted to imam-hatips, 50 men and women met over the summer with Zeytinoglu. She told her audience, "The decision to change the school wasn\'t legal. You were never asked if you wanted it to change." Zeytinoglu has five cases in front of the court now, each for a different school. She argued that in Gongoren, officials did not adequately consult parents and gave no notice before converting the school. Further, there was insufficient demand for religious education in the neighborhood given that it already had seven other imam-hatips.One parent, Gulay Kacar, a stout woman who wore a paisley headscarf, has a son in the fifth grade at Mehmet Akif Middle School, now an imam-hatip. To avoid religious education, which she said will deprive her son of science classes, she will have to send him to a school in another neighborhood where, "there is so much violence, people are stabbing each other." She told the parents, "They put pressure on us. They force our kids to have the education that they want."Kacar, along with Nurcan Aybalik, whose child was also a student at the now-converted school, set up a signature drive in the Kale Outlet Mall in the city center. Shortly after, five clean-shaven youths approached them and swore at the two women, telling them that they had loosened their headscarves and had made prostitutes of themselves by questioning Islam. "Islam is coming and we will make you observe our laws," they said, according to both Kacar and Aybalik.  Umit Bektas / ReutersStudents of an Imam Hatip high school march during a Republic Day ceremony in Ankara, Turkey, October 29, 2015.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display("dfp-ad-x90_2");    });  Extremist views are on the rise in Turkey. Twenty percent of Turks support responding to an insult against Islam with violence, up almost 8 percent from last year, according to the Turkish polling firm Metropoll. A Pew Research Center poll released last month reported that eight percent of Turkish people have a favorable opinion of ISIS and 19 percent are "undecided.""Because of the mindset of religious education, we are being polarized," said Aybalik. Erdogan and the AKP have fought hard to hold onto their tenuous majority in parliament, and religious values are a cornerstone of their message to their Sunni Muslim base. Meanwhile, political opponents warn that religious educational policies will polarize the citizenry. Minority groups, especially Alevi-Muslims, who follow a blend of Shia and syncretic beliefs and make up as much as 25 percent of the Turkish population, are increasingly alienated.In 2011, three Alevi Turkish parents of secondary school students brought a complaint before the European Court of Human Rights, stating that their children were forced to attend Sunni Islamic classes, in violation of the first protocol of the Convention on Human Rights Protocol: the right to education. In February of this year, the court made a final ruling, determining that Turkey\'s compulsory religious education violates children\'s rights. Turkey\'s own highest court ruled similarly in June, deeming the AKP\'s policies unconstitutional. The government has ignored these rulings. Some fear that the European Union, which recently pledged $3.2 billion in Syrian refugee aid to Turkey--in return for helping staunch the flow of migrants into Europe--may in the future turn a blind eye to such human rights abuses in Turkey.  Murad Sezer / ReutersTurkish girls read books at the library at the Kazim Karabekir Girls\' Imam-Hatip School in Istanbul, February 10, 2010.As for claims that these religious schools breed extremism, Turkey\'s religious leaders have countered that their Sunni education has nothing to do with radical Islam. "Islam is a religion of peace and we teach this," said Huseyin Korkut, the head of Onder, an umbrella organization for imam-hatip alumni. "Among the graduates [of imam-hatips] almost no one joined Al Qaeda or ISIS." Indeed, many graduates become public servants.  However, radicalism is a growing problem in Turkey. More than 1,000 have joined ISIS--many of them disaffected youth from neighborhoods with limited educational opportunities--and the presence of extremist recruitment cells in Turkey\'s southern provinces is well established. Although there is no evidence that the imam-hatips are a source of radicalization in Turkey, it is crowding out opportunities to build critical thinking and appreciation for other religions. That certainly does not help combat ISIS, an extremist group that justifies killing and raping of non-Muslim "apostates."To be sure, the problem isn\'t just a Turkish one. In ISIS-controlled areas of Iraq, the curriculum teaches the group\'s extreme Salafist interpretation of Islam, with a focus on militancy and fighting "non-believers," even at the primary school level. In Syria, even outside of ISIS\' domain, radical Islamic groups such as Jabhat al Nusra have opened sharia schools where girls must where the niqab and are segregated from boys. And in Jordan, which has sent 2,000 fighters to ISIS, schoolbooks teach that "holy war" and the killing of captured enemies are appropriate responses to attacks on Islamic lands. Zogan Obiedat, a former Education Ministry official, recently warned, "Islamic State ideology is there, in our textbooks." In fact, the Jordanian government has launched an initiative to rewrite its textbooks.For her part, Kacar insists that her fight is not against religious education for those that want it--she herself is a devout Sunni Muslim, although she did not go to an imam-hatip. She is fighting for the right to choose her child\'s education, a principle enshrined in international law. But for now, it seems that Erdogan is winning. At the end of November, the courts had not given a ruling on any of Zeytinoglu\'s five cases. Kacar was unable to keep her son at home any longer, and so he, along with hundreds of other children from Gongoren, started school in the next town over. '

S'"France is our oldest ally," U.S. President Barack Obama reminded Americans on November 13, after ISIS terrorists launched coordinated attacks in Paris, killing 130. Indeed, the French sent an ambassador to the breakaway colony back in 1778, and Benjamin Franklin arrived in Paris the next year, establishing the United States\' first foreign mission. Gerard Araud, a career diplomat who began as a Middle East specialist, has served as French ambassador to the United States since September 2014; before that, he led France\'s permanent mission to the UN. Araud spoke with Foreign Affairs deputy managing editor Stuart Reid at the French embassy in Washington, D.C., on December 16, 2015.The attacks on Paris were disturbing not just because of the loss of life but also because they struck a city that symbolizes openness. Have the attackers succeeded in jeopardizing the liberal values that Paris represents?The answer is no. But after such a terrorist attack, you are obliged to take some law-enforcement measures. Any liberal democracy has a delicate balance between civil liberties and law enforcement. After 9/11, you had the Patriot Act. After this attack, we have the state of emergency in France.More serious is that the attackers want to create a rift between French Muslims and other French citizens. The French authorities are very keen on avoiding it, but you saw the result of the recent elections in France, where the far right did very well.It\'s a bit like Trump. Trumpism is a transatlantic phenomenon. The problem of backlash against Muslim citizens that you have in this country after San Bernardino, we have in Europe.Why have Muslim immigrants to France, and even their children and grandchildren, had trouble integrating?May I ask you why African Americans have problems of integrating 10 generations after they arrived in the U.S.?The fact is that in Europe, not only in France, most of the recent immigrants are Muslims. Thanks to the economic crisis exported by the U.S. in 2008, Europe is going through an economic dire strait, especially in southern Europe, where the unemployment rate is very high. As usual, the people who are hit most by unemployment are the last to arrive: the immigrants. So we have problems of integration. But you don\'t blow yourself up because you are unemployed.When you look at the profile of Muslim terrorists, you discover that a lot of them were middle-class and had a job. Their parents were perfectly integrated. Very often, the profile of the radicalized youth is someone from a totally normal family that is Muslim, but in a very moderate way. And suddenly, they see their son or daughter getting radical--he starts not to touch his mother, starts to insult his sister because she wears Western clothing, and so on. Social integration is a challenge we all face. But the real question is the process of radicalization of a tiny part of the community.Why do U.S. conservatives love to bash France?    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display("dfp-ad-x90_2");    });  Actually, right now, it\'s the opposite. Conservatives in the U.S. love France because we were firm in negotiations with Iran, our soldiers are fighting in Mali against the terrorists, we were the first to join the American strikes against ISIS, and we have deployed an aircraft carrier in the Gulf to support the Americans.There has always been a tradition of French bashing, which is linked, I guess, to the fact that we are very two different countries. The U.S. was created against the British colonial state, so there is a tradition of considering the state the problem. Look at the guns issue. People say, "We need guns in case the state becomes a threat." In France, we have a totally different relationship with the state. When Tocqueville came to America and wrote Democracy in America in 1835, he emphasized this point.On top of this misunderstanding, we have the Iraq crisis of 2003, where we were right, obviously. The American intervention was a total geopolitical disaster.We\'ve gone from freedom fries to nous sommes tous franais.Exactement. What has been striking is the outpouring of American solidarity after the attack, from President Obama to the man in the street. Our embassy was totally overwhelmed by flowers, we have received thousands of messages, and people are still offering their condolences. Immediately after the November 13 attack, the U.S. administration was extremely supportive, especially in terms of intelligence sharing.We are shoulder to shoulder, facing the same challenge. The only difference is that thanks to your geography, you are much further from the danger than we are. But you have seen the same threat with San Bernardino.You mentioned the intervention in Mali. France has also intervened in the Central African Republic, and in 2013, President Hollande supported punishing Syria with airstrikes for using chemical weapons. What explains this more activist French foreign policy?Rather than seeing a general trend, look at each of these crises. In the case of Mali, the country was collapsing and could have been a failed state taken over by terrorists. It\'s a former French colony, and the second-biggest Malian city is a suburb of Paris. We have hundreds of thousands of Malians in France, and these people are shuttling back and forth, so it would have been extremely dangerous for us. And West Africa was a French colony, where we still have thousands of French citizens and dozens of French schools. We had to intervene to defend our interests.In Central Africa, it\'s totally different. It\'s a very poor country. It has absolutely no interest in economic terms, so we didn\'t have any appetite to intervene. But there were massacres between Muslims and Christians, and the public in France, contrary to the rest of the world, knows where the Central African Republic is, so there was pressure to end the slaughter. To be frank, the French army didn\'t want to go. This sort of mission is always extremely frustrating. Nevertheless, it was so awful that we decided to send a few hundred soldiers.Speaking of Syria in 2013, do you think Obama\'s decision not to go through with air strikes damaged U.S. credibility?I\'m a French ambassador to the U.S., so I\'m not going to criticize the president. But like my president has said publicly, you can always argue, but we think we could have changed the course of the war and should have proceeded with strikes against Assad.I can understand from the American perspective that core U.S. interests are not engaged in Syria. The problem is that for the Europeans--your most solid and ancient allies--the Syrian crisis is becoming critical. In terms of fighters, thousands of Europeans have gone to Syria, and they will come back. The second element is the more than one million migrants. Try to imagine what would happen in the U.S. if one million migrants were crossing the Rio Grande.What specifically could have been done earlier to prevent what\'s happening now?The key problem from the beginning is Assad. In 2011, you had peaceful demonstrations in Syria, and at the same moment, you had peaceful demonstrations across the border in Jordan. But the Jordanians tried to respond to the political and social demands of the demonstrators, while the Syrian regime simply shot at the demonstrators. After that, little by little, it became a civil war. The problem with civil wars, as we\'ve seen in Spain in \'36-\'39, is that usually, the moderates are not good soldiers, and the radicals are. The radical elements of the Syrian rebels have taken the upper hand. It\'s hypothetical, but in 2013, it could still have been possible to get rid of Assad and have a palatable Syrian alternative. Now, it\'s more difficult.Why has Vladimir Putin decided to intervene in Syria?The Russians have always been very clear. They said, "We are not married to Assad, but the choice is between Assad and the radical Jihadists, and we prefer Assad." Why have they substantially increased their presence? In the spring and summer of 2015, we saw many signals that the Syrian army was exhausted. Obviously, the Russians and the Iranians thought they had to step in to preserve the Syrian regime. That\'s the reason they are striking the opposition and not ISIS, because the people fighting Assad are the opposition and not ISIS.Is it possible the Russians are right that there is no good alternative to Assad at this point?What the Russians are telling us is, "OK, you don\'t like Assad, but that\'s not the priority. The priority is fighting ISIS, so let\'s fight ISIS together." And to fight and win, you need ground forces. If you look around the region, the Kurds are not going to fight ISIS, because they are defending Kurdistan. The Shiite militias from Baghdad are not going to fight ISIS, because they are defending their turf. They\'re not going to go to Mosul; they don\'t care about it. So you can say that the Assad army is the only solution. That\'s more or less what the Russians are telling us.Our answer is twofold. First, the Syrian army is exhausted. They can\'t do it. We estimate that around 40,000 Alawites have died, because the best forces are Alawites, and there are only 1.2 million of them. More important, ISIS is an answer to a real problem. We see ISIS only for its atrocities. Actually, ISIS is also filling a vacuum, which is Sunni-stan. With Assad on one side and the Shiites in Baghdad on the other, the Sunnis don\'t have a defender, so ISIS has stepped in. And if we support Assad, it will encourage more Sunnis to rally to ISIS. So our answer is, yes, it will be up to the Syrian army to do the job--but an inclusive Syrian army, after political transition in Damascus.How can you be sure that France\'s stepped-up air campaign doesn\'t create more terrorists than it destroys?Frankly, at some point, when you have enemies, you have to kill them. It\'s brutal, but it\'s a war. What would be the other solution? These people come to our countries and blow themselves up in our theaters. They are threatening us every day--threatening the security of French schools, the security of French embassies abroad. They don\'t leave us any other choice. We have to defeat them.What does a political settlement to the Syrian civil war look like?Our counter example is what the Americans did in Iraq. It\'s very important to keep the security apparatus of the regime intact so that the country doesn\'t collapse into total anarchy. We have to keep the Syrian army, we have to keep the Syrian security apparatus, we have to keep the administration at a high level.We have to have a government of national unity organizing elections to have a representative Syrian government. You can object, "Is it possible to organize free elections with Assad? Is it possible to organize elections considering that the opposition is really fragmented?" It\'s quite a challenge.It won\'t work if it\'s imposed from outside. It will work only if the Syrians are exhausted enough. A civil war stops either with the total victory of one side or when the people say, "enough is enough."What is the moral responsibility of France when it comes to accepting refugees from Iraq and Syria?There was an agreement between the EU countries to share the burden. France was supposed to take 24,000 refugees, and eventually, even after the attack, we are going to accept 30,000. We are facing the same situation that you are facing in terms of immigration. On one side, yes, there is a moral responsibility. We have to help these refugees. On the other side, we face the very strong reaction of the anti-immigrant movement.Also, and you can consider it a petty calculation, but the fact is, the more you accept immigrants, the more they come. We are in a dead end. We close our borders, these people are going to die on our shores, which is awful. We open our borders, and then there will be more people coming. And I don\'t know any country that is ready to accept millions of refugees.What do you make of the Front National?It\'s the same thing as Trump. Of course, Trump has his personal genius, but it\'s basically the same crisis. The lower middle class feels frightened by globalization, frightened for the future of its children, frightened for its moral and social values. They have the impression that the elite are cut off from them. So they want to try something new. So it\'s the Front National in France, or the extreme right in the Netherlands, or Mr. Trump. It\'s the same solution: building walls, closing borders. And it\'s the same scapegoat: the immigrant. It\'s sad.Do you think the United Kingdom will opt to leave the EU?It\'s possible, and it would be a disaster--for the U.K. and for the EU. We need the U.K. in the EU for a lot of different reasons. The problem is, to be frank, this is a British debate. No other country sees an interest in opening this debate.Does Germany have too much power within the EU?Countries have leverage proportional to their power. Because of its economic performance since the beginning of the crisis, Germany has a lot of influence. But if you ask the question to the Dutch, they will say that France and Germany and the U.K. have too much influence.You\'re perhaps the feistiest diplomat on Twitter. Has this ever gotten you in trouble with your masters back in Paris?When you arrive in Washington, you wonder, what is the use of an ambassador in the modern world? The relationship between the two countries is so intense--in terms of human exchanges, economic exchanges, financial exchanges--that frankly, it can work without the ambassador. As for the political relationship, the national security advisor in Paris is calling Susan Rice, and they don\'t need the ambassador. So I\'ve said, "Let\'s try to use social media"--not in terms of everybody in the country, but at least among journalists and deciders.Also, if you want to have real effectiveness, you have to be feisty. If you simply say, "France is in favor of peace and stability," you\'re not going to be exciting. You need to tease the audience to get their attention.It\'s an experiment. I\'m by far the French ambassador with the most followers, so Paris is following my experience. Maybe from time to time, they believe I went too far. But they have told me only once that I should delete a tweet. And I\'m not going to tell you which.Speaking of one tweet you did delete, after Donald Trump tried to make a political point about gun control after the Paris attacks, you called him a "vulture." Are most ambassadors too prudish about commenting on the domestic politics of the country that they\'re in?I didn\'t comment on domestic politics, because it was after he had said if the French had been allowed to have guns, it wouldn\'t have happened. I was just driving back home, and it was in the moment of a tragedy. That\'s the reason I reacted by saying he\'s a vulture: the blood is still not dry, and already he\'s making this sort of comment. Two hours later, I deleted it--I was not asked to by Paris--because I said, "I\'m not going to enter into a controversy while my people are being killed."I went on Fox News a few days later, and they said, "Don\'t you think that if guns had been available in France, the French could have defended themselves against terrorists?" I simply said, "No, it doesn\'t work this way; it\'s only in the movies." I came back home. On my Twitter account, I had hundred of insults--hundreds!--coming from people from Nevada, Arizona, with 45 followers.Have you been watching the Republican debates?  Yes.What\'s your reaction?We are foreigners. I\'ve always said to my diplomats, "You should consider that we are different." A lot of people believe that Europeans and Americans are more or less alike, with small differences. And I think that approach is leading to misunderstanding. Actually, we are different--in our history, in our political traditions, in our visions of the world. '

S'Hunting giraffes with an AK-47 is not an activity that most people associate with the life of a terrorist, but for al Shabab, big game hunting is but one of the many perks of membership. A recent al Shabab video depicted fighters stalking and shooting giraffes, antelope, and buffalo, frolicking in a swimming hole, and sharing large plates of fresh fruit within Somalia\'s lush expanses. Compared to the brutality of recruitment videos from the Islamic State (also known as ISIS), al Shabab is peddling a softer version of jihad.This take on jihadi life is not always standard fare for the Somali terror group. Al Shabab\'s cinematic efforts often feature brutality and violence. This video, however, is part of an attempt to reinvigorate a key element of its rise that saw it become, for a time, one of the world\'s most prominent terrorist organizations. By casting jihad as a life of adventure and excitement, al Shabab is again trying to lure Western recruits. And its chances of success grow daily.Al Shabab has always prized foreign recruits. In 2008, its spokesman Mukhtar Robow extolled foreign fighters as a "precious element" the group needed to attract. Particularly valued were battle-hardened terrorists from other conflict areas, including Afghanistan and Iraq, who brought fighting acumen, technological skills, and leadership experience. At one time, more than half of al Shabab\'s governing council was thought to be non-Somali.Unskilled recruits from the West have been useful as well. Anywhere from 20 to 60 Somali-Americans joined al Shabab as novice fighters. At least three of them became suicide bombers; others became foot soldiers or propagandists. Several non-Somali Americans also joined the group, as did citizens of Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.  AMISOMA still from Al Shabab\'s recruitment video, geared toward Western recruits.Al Shabab\'s Western recruitment efforts dried up as word of the group\'s brutality toward Somalis and non-Somalis (even those within the group) began to spread. Several attacks within Somalia also soured the public on al Shabab, notably the 2008 suicide attack on a Mogadishu medical school graduation. Its decision to bar aid from southern Somalia during the 2011-2012 famine did not help either; it led to a quarter of a million starvation deaths and destroyed what little support the group had within the Somalian diaspora.Since 2009, there have been few reports of Somali-Americans joining the group; radicalized Somali-Americans instead have preferred to join Middle Eastern terrorist groups such as ISIS. Still, al Shabab tries to woo Westerners back from time to time, and the giraffe-hunting video is the latest attempt. It features English narrations and subtitles, something the first two videos in the series did not, and shows several white terrorists speaking in what sounds like a British accent. And in place of executions and sermons that pepper many of their videos are bucolic scenes of bonhomie and carefree pleasures.This is typical of the propaganda that terrorist groups tailor to Westerners. ISIS, the most successful terrorist organization in terms of recruiting foreign fighters, has published an English-language guidebook on life in its self-styled caliphate that rhapsodizes about the ice cream one can supposedly get there. An al Qaeda manual for recruiters emphasizes building friendships with targets and convincing them that the media unfairly vilifies Islamist terrorists.  YouTubeA still from Al Shabab\'s recruitment video, geared toward Western recruits.Al Shabab is working hard to rehabilitate its reputation with Muslims as part of its new tack. Over the last several years, the group has avoided civilian-focused attacks inside of Somalia in favor of government and military targets. In Kenya, a frequent al Shabab target, the group has also taken a softer approach toward Muslim communities, making a show of sparing Muslim lives during attacks as it tries to cast itself as a defense force against Christian aggression.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display("dfp-ad-x90_2");    });  Al Shabab\'s competition with ISIS for attention, funding, and fighters may lead it to send some of its members westward to sow terror.There are unfortunate trends within Somalia that increase the chances of success for al Shabab\'s charm offensive. A 2006 Ethiopian invasion of Somalia prompted a nationalist backlash that swelled al Shabab\'s ranks. Ethiopia demolished a coalition of sharia courts known as the Islamic Courts Union that had conquered swathes of southern Somalia, but ended up strengthening al Shabab as a result. Recruitment was not limited to Somalis, either: Westerners also joined in the invasion\'s wake, eager to fight Ethiopian "crusaders." Ethiopia has since retreated, but is now back in Somalia as part of the African Union Mission in Somalia. And although many Somalis welcome AMISOM\'s efforts, some of its troops have been accused of raping and murdering civilians, stirring the population\'s ire. The risk of a nationalist backlash against AMISOM grows daily, and is always good fodder for al Shabab recruitment.The danger of further Western recruitment is self-evident. It is rare for foreign fighters to return to their country of origin to continue the jihad, but the recent ISIS attack on Paris, which appears to have involved at least one terrorist returnee from Syria, could be a harbinger of things to come. If it is, al Shabab\'s competition with ISIS for attention, funding, and fighters may lead it to send some of its members westward to sow terror. Doing so would provide the group with a reputational boost in a crowded market.  Fortunately, al Shabab\'s attempts to win Westerners have been largely unsuccessful. Its continued unpopularity is part of the problem, but the rise of ISIS has contributed to the group\'s troubles as well. ISIS is now dominating Western recruitment efforts, even among Somali-Americans.This does not mean, however, that the United States can be complacent. The U.S. government has focused on building bridges with the Somali-American community ever since it began losing citizens to al Shabab recruitment campaigns, and later to ISIS. But every day that AMISOM remains in Somalia to prop up Mogadishu\'s sputtering central government, the risk that al Shabab can capitalize on nationalist resentment grows. ISIS may also have its own reputation problem brewing as unrest over its taxation and extortion practices mounts, which would make al Shabab\'s cultural, linguistic, and religious overtures more attractive for radicalized Somali-Americans.Al Shabab is fighting an uphill battle, but there are several trends working in its favor. The United States is focusing its efforts on fighting ISIS and ISIS recruitment, for example. This is a worthy goal, but Washington cannot afford to overlook the threat posed by al Shabab. It is canny, adaptable, and determined to again win Western recruits--this time with potentially far worse consequences for the West. '

S'Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has made it clear that he has no interest in negotiating with rebels, whom he considers "terrorists." His allies, Moscow and Tehran, also continue to rebuff demands for him to step down. So did it matter that, last week, members of the Syrian opposition repeated their calls for Assad\'s removal in a conference in Riyadh? It is hardly consequential in the near term. But the conference\'s goal--to put the Syrian opposition\'s house in order--is a worthy one. In fact, it is critical for international efforts to end the civil war.Riyadh, along with Ankara and Doha, is committed to toppling Assad. Yet what all three capitals have finally realized is that the Syrian leader\'s departure, whether by force or negotiation, cannot be achieved without a more coherent Syrian opposition that can speak with one voice in international fora and effectively join arms on the battlefield. Of course, unifying the huge mess that is the Syrian opposition is easier said than done. And it\'s not like it hasn\'t been tried before. Over the past four years, none of the attempts by various countries to unify the rebels and the politicians has worked. And so, Saudi Arabia will try to succeed where others before it have failed, even though its own record of bringing together rival Palestinian groups over the years has not been stellar.In a sense, Riyadh cannot afford to fail. A more integrated Syrian opposition is at the core of its diplomatic and military plans in Syria. If Russia and Iran continue to reject negotiations over Assad\'s fate, Saudi Arabia\'s response will be to work more closely with Turkey and Qatar and step up arms and money transfers to what they hope will be a more structured rebel apparatus. If Russia and Iran approve talks in January, the Saudi-Turkish-Qatari axis will want to rein in this new force and present it before the international community as a power that can negotiate with representatives of the regime.  Molhem Barakat / ReutersA fighter from the Tawhid Brigade, which operates under the Free Syrian Army, prepares homemade rockets to be thrown towards the 80th Brigade base in Aleppo, controlled by forces loyal to Syria\'s President Bashar al-Assad, November 11, 2013.Whether Russia and Iran will choose escalation or accommodation partly depends on the nature of this newly shaped Syrian opposition. To assuage international concerns over terrorist infiltration within the opposition, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Qatar have tasked Jordan with creating a "who\'s who" list of the Syrian rebels that would separate the "terrorists" from the "moderates." The easy part is identifying adherents to the Islamic State (also known as ISIS) and Jabhat Al Nusra, the Syrian branch of al Qaeda. The hard part is vetting the rest of the Syrian rebel groups, with Moscow and Tehran breathing down Amman\'s neck. Russia and Iran are closely monitoring the situation and are most concerned about the Saudi-sponsored JayshAlIslam, a collection of 12 rebel groups, and the Turkish- and Qatari-backed AhrarAlSham, an ultraconservative Islamist faction of more than 25,000 fighters with Syrian nationalist leanings.That both groups participated in last week\'s conference in Riyadh suggests that they will not be labeled as terrorist groups, despite Ahrar Al Sham\'s military entente and its sporadic coordination with Jabhat Al Nusra. The groups\' involvement in the conference drew the ire of Russia and Iran, but their objections could be tempered if Saudi Arabia and Turkey manage to extract concessions from their surrogates.  Asking Ahrar Al Sham to meaningfully compromise won\'t be easy because its negotiation ceiling is very high. Its maximalist demands include the establishment of Sharia law in any future Syrian state (which would undermine the secular nature of the state); the total dismantlement of the regime, including its security apparatus (which could lead to the collapse of order, similar to what happened in Iraq in 2003 after the undoing of the Iraqi state); and the rejection of any future government that is based on sectarian and ethnic quotas (even though Syrian society contains various sects and ethnicities, all of whom should be represented in any new political system).Students play during their break inside Hosam Kamel school in the rebel-controlled area of Maaret al-Numan town in Idlib province, Syria October 28, 2015.Despite these problematic demands, Ahrar Al Sham did sign off on the final communique that came out of the Riyadh conference, which clearly calls for an all-inclusive, civic state. It\'s possible, of course, that the group plans to change its mind if and when the transition takes place and then impose its dogmatic preferences. But that is a risk probably worth taking because the alternative--the exclusion of one of the most powerful Syrian rebels groups--would be costly if it leads to Ahrar Al Sham effectively partnering with Jabhat Al Nusra. It is also possible that if the group assumes a political role that is commensurate with its size and power in a future Syrian state, the burden of governance might temper its mindset and make it more accepting of notions of political tolerance and pluralism. That\'s a long shot, though, given its Salafi jihadi ideology.What helps considerably is that Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Qatar have leverage over their proxies--they can stop sending them weapons and money and helping them with intelligence and logistics. However, for these countries to exercise this leverage, Russia and Iran have to give something in return, and it starts with agreeing to a political transition that leads to Assad departing the political scene. There\'s no way around it; no party in Syria will be able to achieve its objectives at the expense of its adversaries or without incurring enormous costs. It\'s good that all regional powers agree that there is no military solution to the Syrian conflict. But this consensus is not enough. They now have to find a way to compromise to attain a political solution. This is where the real diplomacy resides. '

S'In recent weeks, several leading Republican presidential candidates have argued in favor of selectively sealing U.S. borders to Syrians and others. That--and the discontinuation of any Syrian refugee resettlement programs--they argue, will keep the United States safe from terrorist attacks. Such fantastical and ill-informed suggestions are counterproductive on their own terms, but they also distract from very real and consequential ways in which refugees and migrants are being used as political and military weapons.PEOPLE PUSHERSAll sides in the Syrian civil war have, to some extent, strategically engineered mass movements of civilians into and away from their areas of territorial control. In some cases, the systemic depopulation and repopulation of territory represent attempts to gain tactical military advantage. For example, in early October Amnesty International reported that the Democratic Union Party (PYD), a Kurdish rebel group in Syria, was demolishing homes and displacing entire villages in order to, as Mao would have put it, "drain the sea [the civilians] in which the fish [the enemy] swims." The PYD is not alone. This kind of engineered migration has long been a tool of warfare, since noncombatants can provide safety, succor, and support and serve as a source of recruits.Conversely, civilians may also be prohibited from fleeing areas controlled by combatants, in order to shield soldiers and their supporters from military attack. Human Rights Watch reported in early November, for instance, that the rebel group Jaysh al-Islam has been keeping civilian hostages in northern Syria in order to deter attacks by government forces.  Brendan McDermid / ReutersPeople take part in an anti-Donald Trump, pro-immigration protest outside the Plaza Hotel, where U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump spoke, in the Manhattan borough of New York December 11, 2015. Trump vowed to close the borders to Muslims.In other cases, such demographic reengineering schemes appear to be longer-term bids to maintain or secure postwar control of particular pieces of Syrian real estate, through a strategy I have called "dispossessive engineered migration," a subset of which is ethnic cleansing. It has been reported, for instance, that forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad have been selectively cleansing neighborhoods under their control and repopulating them with regime allies, some of whom are internally displaced people from elsewhere in Syria. Likewise, as War on the Rocks reported last week, the self-proclaimed Islamic State (also known as ISIS) has routinely used violence to encourage "infidels" to flee their lands and then offered their property and assets to incoming loyalists. This strategy of seizure and appropriation through forced migration, too, has a long and rather sordid history.But the weaponization of displaced people is not limited to conflict zones; migrants and refugees may also be used for influence far from the battlefield. For instance, during the first week of November, Jamal Zubia, spokesman for the National Salvation Government of Libya\'s General National Congress--one of the two rival governments in Libya--issued a lightly veiled threat against the European Union: if not offered diplomatic recognition and financial assistance, it might actively assist migrants and asylum seekers in their bids to reach Europe. In an interview with The Telegraph, Zubia emphasized that although his Tripoli-based faction was not planning to follow through on its threat imminently, it might well do so in future: "We are protecting the gates of Europe, yet Europe does not recognize us and does not want to recognize us. So why should we stop the migrants here? . . . It is a strategic threat, yes, but I would not rule out us doing it one day."The Libyan warning came close on the heels of analogous threats that Turkey reportedly made in September and October (and possibly earlier). According to The Wall Street Journal, Reuters, and other sources, Turkish demands on Europe included financial aid to mitigate the significant burden of hosting more than two million Syrians, the lifting of EU-related visa restrictions on Turkish travelers, and the reinvigoration of Turkey\'s EU membership bid. By some accounts, Ankara also renewed an earlier demand for the creation of a "safe zone" along the Syrian border.In both the Libyan and Turkish cases, the underlying message was clear: concede to our demands or face (possibly severe) migration-related consequences. Although the Libyan threat apparently remains latent for the moment, a number of Turkish demands have already been met, including an initial three billion euros in aid and the resuscitation of Ankara\'s EU membership bid, according to The New York Times, the BBC, and other sources.Using migration as an instrument of state-level coercion is nothing new. Since the 1951 Refugee Convention came into force, there have been at least 75 attempts by state and nonstate actors to use displaced people as means to political, military, and economic ends. Coercers\' demands have ranged from the simple provision of financial aid to requests for full-scale invasion and assistance in effecting regime change. Such was the case when the exiled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide used the threat of a flood of Haitian boat people into the United States to persuade the administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton to oust the sitting junta and restore him to power in September 1994.Likewise, former Libyan leader Muammar al-Qaddafi rather dramatically promised to "turn Europe black" if the EU failed to meet his demands. Although his objectives varied widely over time--and ranged from the lifting of sanctions to the provision of billions of euros in aid to the quashing of support for protesters in the early days of what became the Libyan uprising--Qaddafi used this tool with varying degrees of success in 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2010, before fatally overplaying his hand in 2011.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display("dfp-ad-x90_2");    });  In nearly three-quarters of the historical cases, the coercers achieved at least some of their objectives. In well over half of the documented cases, they obtained all or nearly all of what they sought, which makes this tactic more effective, albeit harder to successfully manage and control, than either economic sanctions or traditional, military-backed coercive diplomacy.Even more striking, some threats to deploy refugees and migrants as weapons have actually been carried out. In the spring of 1999, then Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic initially threatened and later expelled hundreds of thousands of Kosovars in an attempt first to deter NATO from launching a bombing campaign during the Kosovo war and then to compel the alliance into ceasing it. Former German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer later admitted his regret in not taking Milosevic seriously when he said that he "could empty Kosovo in a week."Former Cuban President Fidel Castro also used migration as a weapon against the United States on at least three occasions: in 1965, in 1994, and, most famously, during the Mariel boatlift of 1980. As with Qaddafi, Castro\'s objectives and demands varied over time but included, among other things, a significant shift in US policy toward Cuban hijackers and the regularization of U.S.-Cuban immigration.FIGHTING BACKDespite its prevalence, this kind of coercion has historically been underreported. For one thing, coercive threats are often issued privately and bilaterally; in many cases, neither coercers nor their targets have incentives to reveal the political blackmail. For another, this kind of coercion is sometimes intertwined with other political considerations. For example, Ugandan leader Idi Amin expelled most Asians from his country in 1972, in what has commonly been interpreted as a naked asset grab, since Asians owned most of the big businesses in Uganda during that period. Far less noted is the fact that approximately 50,000 of those who were pushed out held British passports and that these expulsions happened at the same time Amin was demanding that the British halt a planned drawdown of military assistance to his country. Amin even announced his intention to foist 50,000 refugees on the British, with a convenient 90-day grace period for the country to reconsider its decision on military aid.As in the Ugandan case, the vast majority of known targets of this kind of coercion have been liberal democracies (over 70 percent); another 11 percent have been groups of countries that have included liberal democracies. This is no accident. Liberal democracies tend to be particularly vulnerable because they find themselves trapped between conflicting imperatives. On the one hand, such states generally have made normative and legal commitments to protect those fleeing violence and persecution. On the other, as recent events in Europe and the United States make clear, some segments of democratic polities are strenuously opposed to accepting displaced people, whether for rational economic, political, or cultural reasons or for irrational, xenophobic ones. Because targets cannot simultaneously embrace a given group of migrants and reject them, the incentives to concede to coercers\' demands and make the problem disappear can be compelling.  So what options do potential targets of migration-driven coercion have? There are several, but none is a silver bullet; each has advantages and drawbacks. Targets can concede, but this carries the risk that coercers may repeat and escalate their demands, as Qaddafi did in the 2000s. Alternatively, targets can take military action to change conditions on the ground in countries of origin. But wars are costly and their outcomes uncertain. Again, the Qaddafi example is instructive: the threat of Libyan coercion did not disappear when he did, and subsequent instability in the country and the region does not inspire confidence about the option of regime change.Alternatively, target governments can appeal to their populations to welcome the displaced, emphasizing the long-term economic virtues of migration, particularly for countries suffering declining birthrates and shrinking tax bases. If this strategy succeeds, coercion becomes impossible because threats of "flooding" will, in theory, be met with a shrug. But this kind of attitude change tends to be the result of a long-term campaign. The strategy is generally not effective in the midst of an ongoing migration emergency. And it would be particularly challenging in the wake of the attacks in Paris, in light of the fact that at least one of the ISIS-aligned attackers traveled to Europe in the midst of a stream of displaced people.Finally, and conversely, targeted states can abrogate their commitments, close their borders, and lock their doors. This, too, makes successful migration-driven coercion difficult, if not impossible. However, such a stance often encourages others to follow suit and would represent an abandonment of key components of liberal democracies\' most enviable values. In the end, the long-term costs to liberal morals, philosophy, and identity may be far greater than any short-term humanitarian- and assimilation-related costs that come from accepting migrants and refugees, the real victims of this kind of coercion. Such an approach is also very unlikely to solve migration-related security concerns. Indeed, sealing the borders to migrants and refugees may ironically help feed jihadist narratives, which in turn may sow the seeds for a different kind of weaponization of the displaced. '

S'Across Russia, from St. Petersburg in the north to Volgograd in the south, truckers are on strike. They\'re angered by a new road tax that they say is rooted in corruption and will bankrupt them. And so, some 200 long-haul drivers have disrupted roads for over two weeks and have vowed to take their motorized protest to Moscow unless the Russian government removes the tax, fires the transport minister, and fines the oligarch Arkady Rotenberg and his son, whose company was selected to collect the new fees.In the region and beyond, similar movements that were catalyzed by grievances about corruption and involved diverse groups of protesters, including young people, professionals, and blue-collar workers, have toppled other regimes, including that of Viktor Yanukovych in next-door Ukraine. In his increasingly authoritarian rule, Russian President Vladimir Putin has often denouncedsuch revolts, presumably fearing the same fate. Now he must be especially worried. Past protests in Russia have typically been confined to Moscow and attracted mostly liberal elites, so dissent from a blue-collar constituency hailing from the heartland can\'t be good news.Although there\'s a chance that this nonviolent civil resistance might catalyze broader action, whether it will produce a democratic breakthrough depends on the desire and ability of the truckers--and the others now joining them--to diversify their support base, tap into economic and ethnic grievances nationwide, and organize.  Maxim Shemetov / ReutersA participant wears a T-shirt with an image of Russian President Vladimir Putin during an opposition protest march in Moscow, June 12, 2013.The Russian truckers\' resistance reveals growing unhappiness among ordinary Russians. Although the drivers insist that their protests are strictly over economic issues and that many of them support Putin, in reality, tax policies, inflation, and corruption are highly political issues. The Russian economy is ailing: oil prices are in steady decline, inflation is up 15 percent, the economy is expected to contract by almost four percent in 2015, and average real incomes are set to lose an additional five percent this year. U.S. and European sanctions imposed on Russia following its annexation of Crimea and the war in eastern Ukraine have hobbled the banking, energy, and arms sectors and look set to be renewed. Meanwhile, Russia is now actively involved in two wars--in Ukraine and in Syria--a further drain on the national treasury.The truckers have avoided attacking Putin directly, but it is hard to ignore the politics in the protest signs: "Rotenberg is worse than ISIS" and"Russia without Rotenberg," an echo of the 2011 protest slogan "Russia without Putin." The Rotenbergs, close allies of Putin\'s, some of whom are sanctioned by the United States, would be in charge of levying the tax and taking 20 percent of the proceeds. If the truckers face resistance from the Kremlin, or if their demands go unmet, there is a chance that they will become further politicized. The truckers are at least renewing the idea of civic action in their country. Protest parades and rallies have become rare in Putin\'s Russia, as his government has slammed civil society with a series of draconian crackdowns. Groups such as the lauded Memorial human rights organization and the Association of NGOs in Defense of Voters\' Rights (Golos in Russian) have been forced to close their doors.  Maxim Shemetov / ReutersA police officer walks past a line of trucks, whose drivers are taking part in a protest against a new fee, at a parking lot in the Moscow region, Russia, December 8, 2015.According to the Russian youth activist Oleg Kozlovsky, the truckers\' revolt has led to a debate within Russian civil society about whether the resistance has staying power. Although the obstacles to forming a mass movement in Russia are daunting, it is never easy to predict when the sparks will ignite widespread civic action. Even TASS, Russia\'s official news agency, noted in an "expert opinion" on November 20 that the truckers\' protest posed a threat because it tapped into the anger of a bread-and-butter constituency.Although the truck drivers have met with activists and other opposition groups, including activists who have brought them food during protests, they have prevented members of opposition parties from handing out leaflets at their rallies. They believed that such actions were too political and could distract from their cause. In any case, the real threat to Putin is not a Maidan-like movement centered in Moscow--that is, a mass mobilization in the capital that would take over the government--but rather a movement that taps into the anti-Moscow undercurrent that is alive throughout Russia. Discontent has spread as Putin has stripped the regions of powers delegated to them by former leader Boris Yeltsin, including tax authority and the election of governors, while saddling them with forced reforms dictated by Moscow, the so-called May orders, which included plans for economic development, reforms in state administration, and various social reforms, including health-care and ethnic policies. Resentment is growing, too, as regional debt rises and social services are cut to pay for Putin\'s overseas adventures.  If dispersed regional demonstrations attract the participation of aggrieved ethnic groups, many of which have their own republics within Russia, they may pose the biggest threat to Putin\'s grip on power. It is more difficult to brand millions of ordinary people as "traitors" and "CIA agents" than a relatively small number of liberal challengers in the capital. According to a recent poll by the Levada Center and reported by Bloomberg News, most Moscow residents are strongly supportive of the truckers\' strike. One-third of the capital city\'s residents "definitely support" the protest, while 38 percent said they were "probably in agreement."  Maxim Shemetov / ReutersPeople shout slogans during the "March of Millions" protest rally in Moscow, September 15, 2012. Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched though Moscow under streaming banners, flags and balloons on Saturday to demand an end to President Vladimir Putin\'s long rule and to breathe life into their protest movement.Putin, like most authoritarian leaders, is aware of the threat and will do everything in his power to stop the revolt from spreading, including by offering minor concessions.So far, his government has refused to engage in direct talks with the truckers. But the Duma did vote to dramatically reduce the fine for noncompliance with the new law. Perhaps hinting at what could come, Ilya Ponomarev, the only member of the Russian Duma who voted against the annexation of Crimea (and later went into exile), insists that change will come to Russia, but it will take time. He says it will happen through a combination of popular pressure and elites turning on Putin.Research shows that bottom-up nonviolent movements involving strikes, protests, and other acts of civil disobedience attract ten times the level of citizen participation as armed insurgencies, and they are twice as likely to succeed. Popular nonviolent movements also correlate with democratic consolidation. Movements don\'t succeed, however, because of spontaneous outbursts of dissent. They succeed because of organization, planning, and wide popular support. If nothing else, the truckers have sounded an alarm that the Kremlin has undoubtedly heard loud and clear. '

S'In 2010, a disturbing report made its entry into an already upsetting news cycle. Members of a U.S. Army brigade, assembled into a self-proclaimed "kill team," had indiscriminately targeted civilians in southern Afghanistan. As trophies for their deeds, the soldiers collected fingers, leg bones, and skulls from their victims. Photos taken by the soldiers posing next to dead bodies came to light, along with the fact that the main instigator kept tally of each victim by having skulls tattooed on his calf.Such news reports, a sadly recurring feature of contemporary life, trace a predictable arc. The initial horror quickly subsides in the face of official reassurances and the unrelenting tide of other news. Should the public seek to draw lasting political conclusions from such horrors, it will be predictably reminded that there is only one: that an atavistic darkness has lurked in the hearts of man since the emergence of the species.Even a cursory reflection on the available facts, however, shows that such atrocities are not aberrations committed in a political vacuum. Calvin Gibbs, the main instigator of the kill team in Afghanistan, bragged about having done the same things during the occupation of Iraq. But collecting the remains of the enemy was also widely practiced by American soldiers during the Vietnam War. And when Gibbs referred to the victims of his grisly deeds as "dirty savages," he was, consciously or not, tapping into an entrenched history of conquest and occupation.The horrors of the past live in the horrors of the present, and a responsible engagement with the latter requires an understanding of the former. But if a sense of historical continuity is indispensible in dealing with contemporary problems, it would also be incorrect to paint such continuities with too broad a brush. War and violence have been with us for a long time. But the political and economic parameters through which they are produced and reproduced today are part of a historical epoch of which the present is regrettably still a part: the epoch of imperialism. Indeed, after a long hiatus, when it was seemingly banished to the wilderness of esoteric academic debate, "imperialism" is once again a buzzword, either nervously invoked as an old specter to avoid or embraced as a positive good.  Morteza Nikoubazl / ReutersAn Iranian girl carries an anti-U.S. placard bearing an image of U.S. President Barack Obama in Tehran, January 13, 2012.Not surprisingly, the sudden popularity of the term has created great confusion about what it means and why we should care about it. Part of the difficulty is that "imperialism" is used to refer to a hugely diverse range of economic, political, cultural, and linguistic phenomena across centuries and continents. From the Persian empire of antiquity to contemporary American military operations in the Middle East, from China\'s economic penetration of Africa to the old Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, every real or perceived form of hierarchy or privilege has been called imperialism. But such broad use of the term deprives it of analytical meaning; that is why it is useful to briefly examine the emergence and evolution of the term itself.Although "empire" has long historical roots, the term "imperialism" is a relatively recent innovation, making its entrance onto the world stage well into the second half of the nineteenth century. What began as a matter of domestic policy was projected onto the international arena. Initially used to describe the policies of Napoleon III in the 1860s, "imperialism" gradually came to be associated with the new surge of colonial acquisitions by European states. By the 1890s, both supporters and opponents of colonial expansion routinely used the term "imperialism" in their debates over the direction of their societies and, indeed, the world. The term referred to the frenzied struggle that had broken out for a share of the rapidly shrinking pool of territories available for colonial control.Some observers of the day insisted that, in spite of certain superficial similarities, these were not like the vulgar empires of the past, at least in an economic sense. Men like Cecil Rhodes proudly wore the mantle of "imperialist," not just because of the immense wealth that was being accumulated in the enterprise but also because imperialism promised a solution to the problem of maintaining social order at home. As Rhodes argued, the only way to deal with a burgeoning working class in England was to ensure high rates of profits that would trickle down to them, as well as to acquire new territories where they could migrate. Moreover, the benefits of imperialism would extend beyond the great unwashed at home by bringing civilization into the farthest and darkest corners of the world.Lenin insisted that imperialism was not just a misguided set of policies with lamentable human consequences but a full-fledged economic and political system on a global scale that had to be confronted as such.This happy picture of imperialism didn\'t persuade all. The rise of the international socialist movement in particular set the stage for a decisive turn in the way imperialism was understood and used in the broader political discourse. As the great powers of the day hurtled into what would come to be known as the First World War, the Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin wrote a short, explosive pamphlet that laid out the origins, the trajectory, and the essentially undemocratic, exploitative nature of imperialism. Building on the work of other writers such as British liberal John Hobson and the Austrian Marxist Rudolf Hilferding, Lenin insisted that imperialism was not just a misguided set of policies with lamentable human consequences but a full-fledged economic and political system on a global scale that had to be confronted as such.What made Lenin\'s argument persuasive was that fact that, in spite of the efforts to present the enterprise as civilizing and mutually beneficial, the reality of life for the vast majority of the colonized populations remained a scathing and irrefutable indictment of imperialism. Moreover, despite their rhetorical commitment to the "right to self-determination," the victors of the war to end all wars not only divided up the remains of the Ottoman Empire among themselves but also justified their continued right to colonial rule through the mandate system of the new League of Nations. In other words, they maintained the old imperialist reality through new forms, setting the stage for future conflicts.In this context, the fact that the Bolsheviks not only renounced the territorial acquisitions of tsarist Russia but also publicly disavowed the tsar\'s secret treaties with the other powers only strengthened their anti-imperialist credentials. Even in the throes of a struggle for its own survival, the new Soviet government sought to rally anti-imperialist elements from both colonial as well as colonized countries. In 1920, the Soviet government organized the Congress of the Peoples of the East in Baku. The meeting, attended by over 1,800 delegates from Asia and Europe, linked the fate of the Soviet Union to the defeat of imperialism. Later on, even as the political climate in the Soviet Union had changed considerably, leaders from Asia and Africa sought and received the support of the Communist International to create the League Against Imperialism in 1927.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display("dfp-ad-x90_2");    });  "Imperialism" gave way to terms such as "Orientalism," which looked at the historical encounter between the West and the rest of the world through the prism of cultural studies, rather than politics and economics.Over the course of the next two decades, as nationalist movements around the world became more and more prominent, and as the great powers hurtled toward another catastrophic global conflict, the claim that imperialism was in any way beneficial to the colonized became impossible to sustain. The decolonization of the Third World, beginning after World War II, seemed to confirm this prognosis. Yet this process, which in some instances took the form of an orderly transfer of power between governments, posed new questions. On the one hand, the fall of the empires and the formal political independence of the former colonies appeared to be a significant achievement. On the other hand, exploitation, subjugation, and inequality, to say nothing of conflict and war, could hardly be said to have come to an end in the international arena.The criticism of lingering forms of hierarchy and inequality began to be expressed more in the cultural vein. "Imperialism" gave way to terms such as "Orientalism," which looked at the historical encounter between the West and the rest of the world through the prism of cultural studies, rather than politics and economics.Imperialism had, after all, come to be associated with Marxist politics and, by extension, with the Soviet Union, particularly in the Western academy. By the 1970s, although discomfort with capitalism at home and abroad had far from disappeared, leftists no longer took seriously the notion that a new kind of society was being built behind the Iron Curtain. Many were keen to point out that if the term "imperialism" remained useful, it should be applied first and foremost to the relation between the Soviet Union and its satellites. "Imperialism," as a concept and as shorthand for a certain way to understand the world, was a casualty of this intellectual and political process.The decline in the usage of the term became precipitous in the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union. The end of the Cold War and the declaration of a "new world order" set the stage for claims about the possibilities, if not yet the actuality, of an epoch that would no longer be governed by competition and conflict among great powers. In lieu of the old paradigms, humanitarianism would finally be allowed to bloom. The developments of the 1990s--the Gulf War, the establishment of the international tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, the interventions in Somalia, Bosnia, Kosovo, the signing of the Rome Statute leading to the institution of the International Criminal Court--were hailed as steps fulfilling the great expectations of this era. By the turn of the century, it appeared as though imperialism (both the term and the phenomenon) was a historical relic.  Goran Tomasevic / ReutersU.S. Marine Corp Assaultman Kirk Dalrymple watches as a statue of Iraq\'s President Saddam Hussein falls in central Baghdad in this April 9, 2003 file photo.Within a couple of years, however, imperialism was suddenly back in fashion. Scholars and policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic began making the claim that imperialism had been given a bad rap by leftists, left-leaning nationalists, and ivory tower academics who were unwilling to recognize the hard realities of the past century. The imperialism practiced by liberal states (Britain in the past and the United States in the present), it turned out, was not just beneficial but actually necessary to maintain peace and stability in the world. This, they argued, was particularly true given the large number of failed and failing states that constituted the formerly colonized regions of the world. Not coincidentally, this area included Afghanistan and Iraq, the two countries invaded by the United States in the aftermath of 9/11.Such claims have waned since the inaugural salvos of Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. To a considerable extent, that is a measure of the character, duration, and costs of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. But the arguments about the relevance of imperialism continue to resonate, though perhaps not as originally intended. Mainstream policymakers and political pundits no longer openly associate themselves with the language of imperialism. Once imperialism is invoked, however, its specter is not so easy to banish. It now haunts the discussions surrounding the fallout from NATO\'s war in Libya, the machinations in Ukraine, and the demands for another intervention in Syria.  Was NATO\'s intervention in Libya in 2011 a manifestation of imperialism, even though it was sanctioned by the UN Security Council? Does the seemingly universal concern for humanitarianism and human rights rule out the applicability of imperialism to contemporary politics? Should any sort of predatory foreign policy be regarded as imperialist? The answers to these questions, we believe, can only be found through a sustained historical analysis of the nature and development of imperialism. From the 9/11 attacks to the revolutions in the Middle East; from the persistence of illiberal states to the deterioration of basic democratic rights in the advanced capitalist countries; from the recurring economic crises culminating with the yet unresolved meltdown of 2008 to the bloody wars that continue to wrack every region of the world, imperialism, we argue, remains at the heart of the recent events and ongoing processes that define contemporary politics. Understanding imperialism therefore, is not merely an intellectual endeavor, but rather the most important step in finding a way out of the tragic impasse that characterizes global politics today.Reprinted from Imperialism Past and Present by Emanuele Saccarelli and Latha Varadarajan with permission from Oxford University Press, Inc.

S'"Britain has got its mojo back," declared British Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne in a speech at the Council of Foreign Relations in New York last week. His comments followed a vote in the House of Commons that authorized British airstrikes in Syria. British allies greeted the decision with relief--the vote appeared to reverse what some critics viewed as the United Kingdom\'s inexorable retreat from the world stage.Those critics argued that the United Kingdom had adopted an increasingly parochial attitude toward the rest of the world. They pointed to budget cuts in the military and diplomatic corps, a reluctance to join the campaign against the self-proclaimed Islamic State (also known as ISIS), an approach to China that prioritized narrow economic interest over broader strategic concerns, an inability to formulate a strategy to respond to Russian aggression in Ukraine, and British skepticism toward the European Union, with a referendum on membership of the EU likely to take place in 2016.Over the last couple of months, the British government has certainly taken steps to address some of its foreign policy shortcomings--a process no doubt facilitated by the terrorist attacks in Paris. The vote in the House of Commons was the clearest illustration, as British parliamentarians finally cleared the way for the United Kingdom to join the coalition against ISIS in Syria. The United Kingdom\'s military contribution will only have a marginal impact. To date, British airstrikes have carried out around eight percent of the total carried out against ISIS in Iraq. But the political signal was much more valuable, particularly in the wake of explicit calls by the French government for British assistance.How lasting these changes prove to be, however, and whether they represent the germs of a coherent strategic approach to foreign relations, still remains to be seen.A FORCE AWAKENS?Ten days after the Paris attacks, the prime minister announced a 12 billion pound (about $18 billion) increase in the defense equipment budget over the next decade. Some of this money will go toward filling known gaps, including funding nine maritime patrol aircraft to address the threat posed by Russian submarines. Two days later, the Foreign Office avoided further cuts when George Osborne delivered his autumn statement and spending review in November, setting out the government\'s spending priorities for the next five years.These are positive signs. But important challenges remain, including how best to address the remaining shortfalls in defense spending. And if future tax revenues fail to meet Osborne\'s expectations, any increases in spending that do pass now may be temporary.But more important than budgetary concerns is whether the United Kingdom will rediscover what former Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir Nick Houghton has called the "courageous instinct" to commit militarily, including the deployment of ground forces when the need arises. The government has ruled out the commitment of boots on the ground in Syria. And its reluctance to get too deeply embroiled mirrors public opinion. Whereas 59 percent of the public supported British airstrikes against ISIS on November 17, only 48 percent did by December 1.  Russell Cheyne / ReutersA Royal Air Force Tornado takes off from RAF Lossiemouth with the moon in the background, in Scotland, December 2015.Beyond the immediate threats confronting the country, the United Kingdom\'s broader approach to international affairs still remains ambiguous. Chinese leader Xi Jinping\'s visit to London in October reignited fears about the United Kingdom\'s willingness to put economic gain above the defense of the liberal international system. The British government treated the Chinese president to a lavish welcome--at Buckingham Palace, 10 Downing Street, the prime minister\'s country house at Chequers, and Westminster Palace. British ministers again avoided mention of any of the fraught geopolitical issues provoked by China\'s rise. At some point, the government will face the consequences of continuing to affirm its attachment to its Western allies while relentlessly pursuing narrow economic advantage in its dealings with Beijing. If the Chinese openly threaten the rules based international order, the United Kingdom may have to choose between loyal membership of the Western club and being, in Osborne\'s words, China\'s "best friend in the West."    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display("dfp-ad-x90_2");    });  And, of course, there remains the elephant in the room. Although British Prime Minister David Cameron has pledged solidarity with the French, he also maintains that he may still campaign for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. His decision, he claims, will hinge on his success in getting what he wants from his "renegotiation" with other member states.Europe has not been so insecure since the end of the Cold War.It is hard to show solidarity with European partners while holding ransom the very club they depend on to help them confront their challenges. It has not escaped attention that some of Cameron\'s demands are trivial, such as his insistence on increasing the competitiveness of the European economy, a goal the European Commission is already pursuing.There could hardly be a worse time for the United Kingdom to rock the EU boat. Europe has not been so insecure since the end of the Cold War. And these insecurities require collective responses. It is because European sanctions on Russia are collective that they have inflicted the pain they have. If Europeans are serious about stabilizing other parts of the world--if only to prevent future waves of migrants--their actions must be collective.    Suzanne Plunkett / ReutersBritain\'s Prime Minister David Cameron leaves Downing Street in London, December, 2015.Perhaps the United Kingdom has indeed turned a corner. Perhaps the Paris attacks and the vocal criticism of the United Kingdom\'s foreign policy have provoked a serious reconsideration. But Cameron is a tactician rather than a strategist, and whether these short-term measures signal a durable shift toward longer-term engagement remains to be seen.Finally, domestic politics will play a part. Cameron has announced that he will step down before the 2020 election. Osborne\'s New York speech formed part of an increasingly clear attempt to appear prime ministerial by playing a more prominent role in foreign policy. Osborne is more responsible than anyone else for the close relationship that the United Kingdom has built with Beijing. With a leadership struggle on the horizon, the United Kingdom\'s newfound solidarity with its Western partners may remain tentative. Yet if the country has not resumed a central role in world affairs, it has at least not turned its back on the international stage entirely. '

S'As Syrian civilians suffer ceaseless indiscriminate attacks, millions of their compatriots flee their homes, and the self-proclaimed Islamic State (also known as ISIS) extends its killing beyond Syria and Iraq, the only good news coming out of the Middle East\'s most violent conflict is that the contours of a deal to end it have become clearer. After talks in Vienna in late October, the main foreign actors in Syria\'s civil war issued a declaration outlining the principles that could guide some of the conflict\'s combatants toward a political settlement. The Vienna declaration calls for secular governance, the eventual defeat of ISIS "and other terrorist groups," the maintenance of the country\'s prewar borders, and the protection of minority groups and state institutions, among other provisions. Yet it fails to address a key issue: how the warring parties might build the trust needed to achieve such goals. As negotiators prepare for a new round of talks in New York in late December or early January, it is essential that they address trust building head-on, above all by demanding an end to the attacks on civilians that are driving Syrians apart and by sidelining the people who have been responsible for them.BOTTOM LINESBy now, it should be clear that none of the Syrian combatants are capable of prevailing militarily. Even with Russia\'s entry into the war and the backing of Hezbollah and Iranian troops, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\'s forces have not been able to make significant advances against the rebels. Nor have opposition fighters managed to make much of a dent in the government-held corridor between Damascus and the Mediterranean coast. The stalemate should convince all involved of the need for a political compromise.  Alaa Al-Faqir / REUTERSA building damaged by what activists said was shelling by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in Bosra al-Sham, Syria, September 2015.If it is to have a chance of succeeding, such a compromise must be based not on the wish lists of the warring parties but on their bottom lines. The armed opposition groups and some of their foreign backers would like to see Assad and his chief lieutenants leave office tomorrow. After all, these Syrian officials have been the architects of a brutal strategy of indiscriminate attacks in opposition-held areas, with the apparent aim of depopulating those regions and showing other civilians the consequences of rebel control. Yet apart from those extremist groups seeking to break the country apart, it is in no one\'s interest for the Syrian state to implode, as might result from the abrupt departure of Assad without a replacement plan, because that could produce even greater violence. The maintenance of the security forces and a functioning justice system will be especially important, since their collapse would lead to a loss of order that would particularly endanger Syria\'s many minorities. In other words, a managed transition away from the Assad regime is the best course.Achieving an accord depends on developing a level of trust among Syria\'s many warring factions that is currently lacking. Assad and his chief lieutenants, of course, would like to stay in power indefinitely. But given their countless atrocities--the use of chemical weapons; the repeated barrel bombing of civilian neighborhoods and institutions; the mass detention, torture, and execution of perceived opponents--the opposition has made clear that it will never accept their rule in the long term. Even Russia has hinted that it is not wedded to Assad so long as he leaves through negotiation rather than popular revolt, and Iran has repeated a similar line. Both countries seem more concerned with the friendliness of the regime in Damascus than with who heads it. Assad does represent a powerful faction in the fighting, so there is no avoiding his having a place at the negotiating table, but since his continued rule is untenable, Russia and Iran will need to use their considerable clout to insist on--and enforce--a deal that leads to his departure.AMNESTIES AND ACCOUNTABILITYSo what will happen to Assad if he and his murderous cronies relinquish power under pressure? They will undoubtedly push for amnesty for their crimes, but for a number of reasons, amnesty should not be granted. As a general rule, since the early 1990s, the international community has rightly refused to give its imprimatur to amnesties for mass atrocities; doing so is required by international law, respects the victims, and avoids encouraging further atrocities. Moreover, an amnesty in Syria would be meaningless in some respects. Although Syria is not a current member of the International Criminal Court, any future internationally recognized Syrian government would be empowered to join it and consent to retroactive jurisdiction; should that happen, the court would never accept an amnesty for mass atrocities. Foreign courts exercising universal jurisdiction over alleged Syrian war criminals found on their territory would also be free to ignore an amnesty. Even within Syria, an amnesty could prove ineffective: amnesties for atrocities granted under the pressure of violence have been deemed invalid in such places as Argentina, Chile, and Peru.  Brendan Smialowski / Pool / ReutersRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, and Turkish Foreign Minister Feridun Sinirlioglu in Vienna, October 2015.That said, most negotiators probably do not expect Assad to deliver himself to custody in The Hague, and few would object if he and his henchmen fled to Moscow or Tehran, leaving for another day the question of whether they could later be apprehended for trial. If they stay in Syria, as Assad has vowed to do, the key would be to reject any attempt to foreclose a future reckoning through a formal amnesty.Other forms of accountability should be wholly non-negotiable and should begin as soon as possible. For starters, the transitional government should include a truth commission with subpoena power to build a detailed historical record of all sides\' atrocities, to collect evidence for future prosecutions, and to establish a system of compensation for victims and their families. And anyone found through an open, contested, and fair process to have been responsible for significant abuses, including Assad and his coterie, should be barred from public office.PARTICIPATORY GOVERNANCEIf Assad and his circle are precluded from holding power, who would replace them? According to the Vienna declaration, that question would be answered by UN-supervised elections. But credible elections in war-torn Syria, where millions have been displaced, will take considerable time and preparation. Initially, then, it will be necessary to establish a coalition government by agreement, led by figures with credibility among both Syria\'s Sunni majority and the Alawite and other minorities that have largely entrusted their fate to Assad. Syrians participating in the negotiations would determine the components of this coalition--the Vienna declaration calls for "credible, inclusive, non-sectarian governance"--but the possibility for compromise would increase greatly if the international community demanded that the future leadership of Syria exclude people who have been found responsible for mass atrocities. That position is necessary not only for reasons of accountability but also because it is difficult to imagine any consensus forming around those who have committed such crimes.As for the structure of such a coalition-led government, given Syria\'s history of repression at the hands of a strong central government--and the multiplicity of forces controlling various parts of the country--a hefty dose of local self-rule will probably be unavoidable. At least at the outset, that would place a great deal of governmental authority in a collection of fiefdoms rather than a strong, centrally directed state. Such decentralization would have to be accompanied by guarantees that all groups living under these coalition forces, including minorities, can participate in local governance--at a minimum, through formal consultative processes. The aim should be to replace Syria\'s rigid top-down system with participatory, negotiated power structures, accompanied by functional security and justice systems. The recent experience of governance in Kurdish-controlled areas and the short-lived but rich experiments of some of the local councils operating in opposition-held areas in 2011 and 2012 offer useful precedents. Given the likely reluctance of opposition groups to give up their weapons, even the fight against ISIS will probably involve a good deal of coordination among decentralized, cooperating forces.  Ammar Abdullah / REUTERSRebel fighters in Hama Province, October 2015.And as for which Syrian opposition groups should be included in a future governing coalition, the key test should be whether they have demonstrated a commitment to avoiding abuses among their own forces and holding accountable those who commit them. Most observers assume that the various member groups of the Free Syrian Army would participate in such a coalition and that Kurdish forces would at least cooperate with it. The largest force whose inclusion in a future coalition is uncertain is Ahrar al-Sham, an Islamist group that has been responsible for atrocities over the course of the war but has presented a more pragmatic faade after September 2014, when most of its leadership was killed in a bomb attack. Whether it can be part of the solution in Syria or is left to fend for itself should depend on a discernible and enduring change in its conduct. Members of both ISIS and the al Qaeda-affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra, meanwhile, would almost certainly be excluded because of their systematic atrocities and the threat they are believed to pose to Western interests. Indeed, a main point of a Syrian deal would be to produce a governing coalition that could fight more effectively against both these extremist groups, if nothing else by supplying more of the ground forces that have so far been in short supply.A PREREQUISITE FOR PEACEAchieving an accord along such lines depends on developing a level of trust among Syria\'s many warring factions that is currently lacking. It is very difficult, after all, to shake hands with opponents who are killing one\'s families and neighbors. That is why U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is wrong to prioritize a deal first and atrocities second. Ending the slaughter of civilians--a crime by all sides but, measured by the number of victims, one predominately committed by Syrian government forces--is not a byproduct of a deal but a prerequisite for one. As the principles for an accord are refined, negotiators should not treat the atrocities as a sideshow, as the Vienna declaration did. Instead, they should use their substantial collective influence to insist on an end to them now.  Ending the slaughter of civilians is not a byproduct of a deal, but a prerequisite for one. The UN Security Council has occasionally called for an end to atrocities in Syria. But it did little to enforce such demands, especially after Russia began its military operations in Syria at the end of September. Perhaps to avoid being seen as complicit in attacks on civilians, Moscow then pressured the Syrian government to disavow the use of indiscriminate weapons. Damascus reiterated the pledge in a November 9 letter to the UN. Human Rights Watch\'s research in Syria, however, shows that the Assad government has not lived up to its promise. That must change, and the governments involved in the negotiations--particularly Russia and Iran, whose support Assad needs to survive--should insist that Assad\'s atrocities cease. Ending atrocities would go a long way toward establishing the conditions that might make the Syrian talks succeed. '

S'This is not a particularly happy time in Algerian politics. In the past two decades, the Algerian public has faced two realities: a civil war that threatened to shatter the state from its core and then relative calm under President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. The president, now in his late 70s, has ruled the nation since 1999. Following the Arab Spring in 2010, Bouteflika promised reforms to the Algerian political system that have yet to fully materialize. Global oil prices have plummeted, and Algeria has had to balance its budget by introducing austerity measures. And now, the burden of unpopular economic policies and Bouteflika\'s lingering health problems has led many to fear the return of political uncertainty.The next few years may test Algeria\'s political health, but there are signs that the nation can weather a period of uncertainty. Most telling is that, where decades ago, Algerians demanded democracy, they now hope for continuity. In pursuit of this, the Algerian polity may tolerate pseudo-democratic theatrics--as with Bouteflika\'s unprecedented re-election to his fourth term--as it spells certainty and stability.THE END OF RENTIER POLITICSAlgeria\'s current situation thus threatens to erode two central pillars of its normalcy: Bouteflika and oil profits that have subsidized life for ordinary Algerians. The government\'s recent moves within the economy, presidency, and army can be understood as an attempt to preserve these tenets of the Algerian social contract despite the significant challenges it faces in doing so.First, knowing that Algerian subsidy programs are unsustainable due to falling oil prices, the government is raising taxes and prices on fuel, electricity, automobiles, medicine, telecommunications, and transport gradually, hoping to soften the economic blow to average Algerians. Moreover, core subsidies like housing, education, and defense funding will remain untouched.Second, the government is approaching Bouteflika\'s succession with an eye to continuity, and hopes to mitigate the risk of conflict around the appointment Algeria\'s next leader. Few have faith that Bouteflika\'s health will hold until Algerian elections that are scheduled for 2019. Bouteflika has been in and out of hospitals since 2005, including a major hospitalization in France in 2013, and things carried on as usual despite his absence. It stands to reason that the president\'s coterie is already preparing a successor from within the regime as a placeholder for when the president can no longer remain in power. Every detail of this succession will likely be managed from within.Critically, a third pillar of state legitimacy--national security--has not wavered despite current troubles. Algeria\'s powerful military-intelligence services are still central in maintaining the country\'s security. Algeria\'s murky high politics make it difficult to determine the exact relationship between the executive and the military, but recent trials and punishments against generals for corruption are steps toward improving the perception of military accountability and the perception of the civil state\'s strength. These recent changes signal to the public that both centers of national power are invested in a managed civilian transition of power.  Louafi Larbi / ReutersPresident Abdelaziz Bouteflika arrives for a swearing-in ceremony in Algiers April 28, 2014.Notably absent in this managed change of hands will be a credible attempt to allow Algerians to participate in the process.In some countries, that might be cause for outrage. But Algerians, politically fatigued, are putting democracy on the backburner.It is easy to see why Algerians may not be clamoring for drastic political change. They remember Algeria\'s political unrest of the 1990s, after the military cancelled an Islamist electoral victory, giving way to an armed insurgency that killed hundreds of thousands. And in more recent times, many saw echoes of Algeria\'s past within the Arab Spring\'s aftermath: Libya\'s ongoing civil war has no end in sight. Tunisia, with its triumphs and Nobel Peace Prize-worthy efforts at birthing a democracy, has experienced unprecedented violence. In Syria, the stalled revolution has cost thousands their lives and has encouraged the spread of the Islamic State (also called ISIS). Democracy may seem a worthwhile endeavor intellectually, but stability seems a safer bet.  Of course, austerity could change that calculation. If the financial measures fail to land as softly as planned, Algerians may indeed take to the streets. But if they do so, it will not be for a pie-in-the-sky objective: not for free and fair elections, greater decentralization, nor greater parliamentary power. It will be for their livelihoods.In other words, although Algerian opposition parties warn of a repeat of the unrest seen throughout the 1990s and have called for democratic reforms, observers are skeptical. More likely is a continuation of the current system, in which opposition political parties are considered part of the theatrics: superficially challenging the deep state while being seen as largely co-opted. Meanwhile, the front these parties have formed--a coalition of Islamist, Berberist, Trotskyite parties, and regime defectors--offer few if any viable alternatives to Algeria\'s political status quo, as they lack internal ideological alignment and have contradictory political goals.  Zohra Bensemra / ReutersA woman stands at the entrance of her door at the old city of Algiers Al Casbah, Algeria October 25, 2015.That few viable alternatives to the establishment exist undoubtedly contributes to Algeria\'s wider political disillusionment. But for many, it also underscores the notion that political jockeying, democratization efforts, and reform movements are distractions from the more important need to address social and economic grievances. The idea that citizens prefer survival, stability, and comfort above democracy is not new, but the concept is still a hard one for U.S. sensibilities to stomach. And within Bouteflika\'s Algeria, the widespread sense is "mwalfa kheir men talfa," a rhyme in Algerian Arabic that more or less means, "better the devil you know." Algerian society is lukewarm to the prospect of a managed succession, and is even less willing to believe that true multi-party democracy could flourish instead. The risks are far too high, and the rewards too unlikely. '

S'By the most recent forecast, the U.S. Federal Reserve is set to raise interet rates on December 16. That it\'s happening in the midst of a global economic slowdown is bad news for markets and economies around the world. Even China\'s yuan, which had remained stable alongside the strengthening U.S. dollar until recently, had to decouple from it in August to bolster the country\'s faltering export industries; it was another decision that shook markets worldwide.Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has been warning of the coming interest rate hike for some time now. She wanted to sound the alarm sooner rather than later because the Fed has injected some $2.5 trillion in excess reserves--17.6 times more than the statutory reserves needed to support the present level of U.S. money supply and lending activity. When a central bank has created such an unprecedented degree of liquidity, particularly with the U.S. economy doing relatively well, inflation could accelerate much sooner than in the past once the private sector is ready to borrow money again. That could force the Fed into an abrupt tightening, which could be very damaging to the market and the economy. The Fed must also avoid creating the impression of being behind the curve on inflation lest it trigger a bond market crash that could send long-term interest rates rocketing.  Kevin Lamarque / ReutersU.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen testifies before the Senate Banking Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, July 15, 2014.In spite of the United States\' relatively strong economy, inflation remained subdued because the private sector still maintained a financial surplus of over six percent of GDP, at least through the year ending in the third quarter of 2015, according to the flow of funds data. This is worrying because it means that the private sector continued to save in spite of zero interest rates, a disturbing trend that began when Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008. It also indicates that businesses and households are still recovering their balance sheets, which may have been hurt when the housing bubble burst in 2008. Their refusal to borrow means that the liquidity injected by the Fed remained with the financial institutions that received them and has not entered the real economy.The fact that the private sector as a whole is still saving money at zero interest rates is worrying because both Japan in 2000 and Europe in 2011 tried to raise rates under similar conditions but were ultimately forced to take them back to zero. In both cases, the economies turned out to be much weaker than some macro indicators had suggested.The Fed\'s need to appear vigilant against inflation while facing a still weak global economy suggests that it should reverse the order of monetary policy normalization set forth in September 2014. At that time, it was decided to raise interest rates first before draining excess reserves because the market is more familiar with rate hikes, while a reserve-draining operation would be the first in history and might create unpredictable disruptions.Since the Fed\'s September announcement, however, the dollar has skyrocketed and oil prices have collapsed. This means that inflation is likely to stay subdued, undermining the rationale behind rate hikes.  Toru Hanai / ReutersA man is reflected on an electronic board displaying exchange rates, August 11, 2010.Meanwhile, reserve-draining operations generally require the Fed to sell bonds. Although that would tend to push bond prices lower and yields higher, the Bank of Japan\'s decision in October 2014 to expand its liquidity injections and the European Central Bank\'s decision to do so earlier this year have pushed interest rates in many countries to zero or subzero levels. That move boosted Japanese and European investors\' demand for higher-yielding dollar bonds.This means the Fed has the perfect opportunity right now to sell bonds to drain excess reserves--there is robust overseas demand for U.S. bonds, plenty of domestic savings (at least according to the flow of funds data) to absorb the bonds unloaded by the Fed, and a strong dollar and cheap oil keeping inflation concerns in check. These factors all suggest that any pressures that drive down bond prices and drive up bond yields from a reserve mop-up operation are likely to be modest.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display("dfp-ad-x90_2");    });  In other words, the Fed should drain excess reserves first before raising interest rates. If bond yields do climb excessively because the Fed unloads the bonds, the Fed could always calm the markets by announcing an extension of the zero interest rate policy. When the market realizes that the Fed has this fallback option to keep short-term rates low, long-term interest rates (that is, bond yields) are not likely to go that much higher.  It is better to familiarize the market with this unprecedented mop-up of excess reserves now, when the external environment is ideal. That would mitigate the impact of any future economic shocks such as higher oil prices and a weaker dollar, because by then the market would be accustomed to mop-up operations. If the Fed is concerned about appearing behind the curve in countering inflation, draining excess reserves is also a valid and credible inflation countermeasure.In contrast, if the Fed has to begin reserve-draining operations when policy interest rates are already rising, domestic and foreign appetite for U.S. bonds are waning, and oil prices are rising, chances are high that bond yields will sky rocket, and that would have devastating consequences for the economy.Since the rate hike announcement over a year ago, the external conditions have changed drastically, providing the Fed with a golden opportunity to drain excess reserves.

S'By finally inviting Montenegro to join NATO, the treaty organization has taken a significant step toward ending Russian chicanery in this small but significant Balkan country. But it will have to act fast to secure its gains. If NATO fails to close the deal, Moscow will have an opening to further destabilize the region and undermine Western interests in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Macedonia, and Serbia.In principle, there is little reason to fear.Completing the process of membership requires that Montenegro iron out a few technical details regarding its accession and that the legislative branches of NATO members, including the U.S. Senate, approve the formal protocols.But all this takes time, and Montenegro faces elections in October. This creates a perfect opportunity for Russian subversion.The potential for Russian interference was evident in October, when Montenegrin protesters and police clashed during demonstrations against the country\'s President, Milo Djukaonovic. Although officials in Moscow denied Djukanovic\'s allegations that they orchestrated the protests--and clearly many protesters were demonstrating over corruption and the state of the economy--speculation about Moscow\'s role mounted when the archbishop of the staunchly pro-Russia Serbian Orthodox Church publicly lamented Montenegro\'s separation from "Mother Russia." Meanwhile, in neighboring Bosnia, Russia has become openly partisan in favor of the separatist Serb leaders. The Russian ambassador there recently injected himself in a tense controversy over a highly provocative referendum that could put the country\'s stability in jeopardy. The idea that Moscow would show restraint next door in Montenegro, with a chance to thwart the country\'s NATO bid in the balance, is farfetched.   Stevo Vasiljevic / ReutersRiot police protect themselves with shields during clashes with protesters in front of the parliament building in Podgorica, Montenegro, October 2015.Moreover, Russia has the tools at its disposal to influence next October\'s elections. In addition to the Serbian Orthodox Church and avowedly pro-Serb parties, there is residual anti-Americanism in Montenegro among leftists and green party activists. Elections in Montenegro can be competitive, with control of parliament sometimes decided by five seats or less. Dispensed liberally, Russian propaganda and money could animate the opposition, influence officials, and succeed in propelling anti-NATO, pro-Russia parties into power.Montenegro\'s accession to NATO is particularly irksome to the Russians, since it would become the first Orthodox-majority country of the former Yugoslavia to join the alliance. Montenegro also has historic ties with Bosnia and Serbia; so, should its bid succeed, NATO membership for those two countries would become a plausible, if not an immediate prospect. Serbia\'s nationalist leaders, surprisingly, have already voiced their backing for Montenegro\'s NATO bid, a move that must have worried Moscow, which owns Serbia\'s national oil company and envisions the Balkans as part of its energy domain.But Moscow\'s outright opposition to NATO expansion is a recent posture. It was only after a NATO Summit at Cardiff in 2014 that Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov delivered the stinging pronouncement that Russia would see NATO expansion in the Balkans as a "provocation." Prior to that, Russian President Vladimir Putin had personally informed Balkan leaders, including the President of Macedonia, another Orthodox majority country that he didn\'t care if the country joined NATO. Montenegro itself, even after its bitter split from Serbia in 2006, enjoyed good relations with Moscow and attracted substantial investment from Russia despite its determined course to join NATO and the European Union. All of that changed when the Ukraine crisis erupted last year, forcing Balkan countries to choose whether or not to apply EU sanctions against Russia. While Serbia refrained from doing so, Montenegro followed Brussels\' lead, incurring the wrath of Moscow, which suddenly saw the need to frustrate Western objectives in the Balkans.Montenegro\'s accession to NATO is particularly irksome to the Russians, since it would become the first Orthodox-majority country of the former Yugoslavia to join the alliance.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display("dfp-ad-x90_2");    });  For the United States, the benefits of bringing Montenegro into NATO clearly outweigh the risks of increased tensions with Russia. First, it would close the possibility of a Russian naval basing in the Adriatic, something that Moscow avidly sought last year. Second, it would anchor a country that was once firmly under the grips of former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic into Euro-Atlantic institutions. Third, it promises to spur EU enlargement in the Balkans, which has flagged in recent years. No former communist country has joined the European Union without first joining NATO, and EU accession is a central plank in Washington\'s strategy to press Europe to confront its Balkan backyard.    Jonathan Ernst / ReutersJohn Kerry meets Montenegro\'s Foreign Minister Igor Luksic at the NATO ministerial meetings at NATO Headquarters in Brussels, December 2015.Montenegro stands to benefit, too. The country has watched from the sidelines as tourism from the UnitedStates has soared in neighboring Croatia after Zagreb joined NATO in 2009. Montenegro, whose economy is based on tourism, could use the extra source of income. In addition, NATO membership would likely attract more foreign investment. And respect for democratic values among the country\'s leaders may also grow as a result of joining an alliance dedicated to civilian control of the military.In short, the United States has ample reason to ensure that NATO membership for Montenegro becomes a reality--and to do so before Russia has a chance to skew the country\'s election next fall. With the situation in Bosnia teetering, and with a heightened threat of Islamist radicalization in the region thanks to ISIS, closing the NATO deal with Montenegro is a stabilizing and feasible step to take while U.S. President Barack Obama remains in office. Election year politics in the U.S. Senate--with five senators running to succeed him--mean that the Obama administration will need to make the small country of Montenegro an outsized policy priority.

S'The EU is under siege. The arrival of hundreds of thousands of refugees from Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria has tested the single-border principle at the core of the union. The ongoing financial crisis in Greece has strained the single currency. The United Kingdom will soon hold a referendum on whether or not to exit the EU. The survival of an EU with a single border, a single currency, and a stable membership appears less likely than ever before.European federalists dismiss these problems as growing pains. The EU is an incredibly ambitious work in progress, they note, one that is rooted in a vision of Europe that challenges deep-seated notions of sovereignty and statehood. Surveying the destruction during World War II, Jean Monnet, considered by many to be a founding father of the EU, wrote, "There will be no peace in Europe if the states are reconstituted on the basis of national sovereignty. . . . The countries of Europe are too small to guarantee their peoples the necessary prosperity and social development. The European states must constitute themselves into a federation." Monnet\'s union would be built through cooperation and common markets and would ultimately resemble a "United States of Europe," a phrase later embraced by Winston Churchill to describe his own vision of Europe\'s best possible future. The question is whether that vision can withstand the blows that have rained down on the EU since the financial crisis began in 2008.When the euro was adopted, in 1999, many voiced concerns that the monetary union would prevent countries from responding properly to financial crises because they were forfeiting the ability to devalue their currencies, which most economists contend is the best response to such situations. But the political logic of binding the continent together through a common currency trumped the doubts. Supporters of the single currency argued that crises could be averted through adherence to a set of rules (the Maastricht rules) that prevented countries from accumulating too much debt.The euro supporters\' view took a major hit in 2008, when the financial crisis spread from the United States to Europe. In October 2009, George Papandreou became Greece\'s prime minister and discovered that his country had vastly underreported its debt levels. Greece\'s creditors, particularly French and German banks, were overexposed. The EU called in the International Monetary Fund, fearing that the crisis would spread. It did, and soon Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain were all affected. Negotiations between each government and the so-called troika--the European Central Bank, the European Commission, and the IMF--resulted in EU-IMF programs in Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain.  John Kolesidis / ReutersA protester extends his fingers in a traditional gesture of insult during a rally against a new austerity package in Athens, May 2011.The EU response, and the showdowns it has produced in the subsequent years, has been interpreted by observers in two ways. One view holds that the crisis has drawn Europe closer together. This is what the political scientist Kathleen McNamara argues in her thoughtful new book, The Politics of Everyday Europe. Despite a fraying sense of European solidarity, she writes, EU member states committed roughly one trillion euros to keep the currency afloat and the eurozone\'s member states financially stable. The EU has also inaugurated new institutions designed to help the member states respond to crises: the European Stability Mechanism; a new fiscal compact; and a European banking union, currently under construction. The power of the European Central Bank has increased, she writes, making it "the most effective and active actor in the Eurozone crisis," and European leaders have met more and more frequently in summits "too numerous to count."A less sanguine interpretation of the crisis is that the EU, far from being drawn together, has been split down the middle. Southern European countries, including Greece, Italy, and Spain, blame the EU for punitive austerity measures that have left millions out of work. Meanwhile, northern countries, such as Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, complain that the EU has not been strict enough with highly indebted member states; some officials in those countries, including German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schuble, have openly called on Greece to exit the monetary union. (The refugee crisis has precipitated a similar split, as southern and eastern states have shouldered the bulk of the burden, breeding resentment toward their northern and western neighbors.)At this point, it requires a great deal of optimism to interpret the EU\'s response to the eurozone crisis as proof that the union\'s institutions can steer Europe toward more integration. More likely is the prospect of a more fractious, divided union, drifting away from the vision of its founders and champions.A LESS PERFECT UNIONMcNamara views the EU\'s response to the financial crisis as evidence of the union\'s successful integration. Such a response would have been impossible, McNamara writes, were it not for "decades of slow accumulation of everyday symbols and practices" that "created a permissive consensus for such political developments." These "symbols and practices" include not just the single currency and the absence of border controls but also "European" buildings and spectacles, a common market in European soccer players, a shared statistics agency (Eurostat), and a European diplomatic corps. Put simply, the quiet introduction of European "labels, mental maps, and narratives" has built a European way of interpreting the world.The next phase in creating a federated Europe will not be easy, McNamara concedes. She argues that it will require greater democratic representation, more citizen participation, and a higher quality of debate. "The EU needs more overt contestation and direct discussion of its policies, and debate over its leaders," McNamara writes.Optimistically, McNamara sees such change happening already. As evidence, she points to the most recent election of the European Commission president and to the 2014 EU parliamentary elections, which she describes as "much more publicly contested than any before in EU history," noting that they received "wide coverage in national newspapers" and that "various trans-European interest groups--from students to environmental activists to high-priced consultants"--sought to mobilize EU-wide constituencies.The 2014 EU parliamentary elections may well have been "more publicly contested," as McNamara argues, but the results swept an extraordinary number of anti-EU and anti-euro parties into power. In France, the right-wing National Front won the largest share of the vote; in the United Kingdom, that distinction went to the anti-EU UK Independence Party. In the Netherlands, the Party for Freedom, which has advocated withdrawal from the EU, won more than 13 percent of the votes (it had won an even greater percentage in 2009). In Greece, the neo-Nazi party Golden Dawn won just over nine percent of the votes.It requires a great deal of optimism to interpret the EU\'s response to the eurozone crisis as proof that the union\'s institutions can steer Europe toward more integration.In light of severe government cutbacks across Europe, such results are not surprising. In the wake of the 2008 crisis, austerity has meant fewer jobs, smaller pensions, less affordable health care, tighter school budgets, and cutbacks to local services. People are feeling the pinch, and they are afraid. Meanwhile, support for populist and nationalist parties has risen, and support for the EU has declined. Between 2007 and 2013, the Pew Research Center reports, the EU\'s favorability rating fell by 34 percentage points in Spain, 21 points in France, and 20 points in Italy. As McNamara notes, "The close identification of [austerity] policies with \'Europe\' is an association that is piercing the banal authority the EU has been built on, and creating new challenges for legitimation."Public opinion toward the EU has improved recently, but not much, with the median figure for EU favorability rising from 46 percent in 2013 to 52 percent in 2014. Eurobarometer, a series of public opinion surveys conducted by the European Commission, has shown slight increases in the percentage of Europeans who say they have a positive image of the EU (41 percent in May 2015, up from 39 percent in November 2014), trust the EU (40 percent, up from 37 percent), and feel that their voice counts in the EU (42 percent, up from 40 percent).It\'s unclear, however, whether this trend has much to do with the new institutions the EU created in the wake of the crisis and which McNamara hails. Once the crisis erupted, it became clear that the EU\'s rules on debt management were not being enforced, that its banking regulations were inadequate and ill equipped to deal with cross-border issues, and that the EU had no centralized fiscal capacity to bail out a member state. Still, the eurozone\'s members held together, aware that the cost of a Greek exit would be greater than the cost of a bailout. In 2012, they signed a treaty creating the European Stability Mechanism, which comes with an emergency lending capacity of 500 billion euros. To borrow from the new fund, countries must submit an outline of their economic programs for approval by the troika and ratify the new fiscal compact, a strict set of rules designed to prevent countries from going into debt--in part by threatening economic sanctions against those that do not comply. EU leaders have also committed to a new banking union.  Bertrand Langlois / ReutersFrancois Hollande (L) and Angela Merkel (R) attend a bilateral meeting ahead of an EU summit on the union\'s long-term budget in Brussels, November 2012.The new institutions may sound promising, but the details reveal significant weaknesses. Germany remains terrified of any initiative that involves sharing liabilities. And so the banking union has no common deposit insurance, no simple resolution process for failing financial institutions, and no single backstop with which to bail out banks. The fiscal compact is simply another version of the Stability and Growth Pact, introduced in 1999, which failed when France and Germany did not abide by it. There is little to suggest that this time around will be any more successful. And the European Stability Mechanism, for its part, is less a sign of European integration than of continued German dominance. It will raise 500 billion euros by selling bonds that will enjoy creditworthiness only because, to quote the credit-rating agency Moody\'s, they are "closely correlated" with key shareholders. Put simply, the markets assume that the European Stability Mechanism will reflect Germany\'s intentions, and the eurozone governments know that there will be negative repercussions at any hint that Germany disapproves of a loan.THE FUTURE OF EUROPEThe EU has survived the crises of the past few years so far, but it seems unlikely to cohere any further into a tightly bound superstate. Three other possibilities seem more likely. The rise of localism, regionalism, and even separatism--witness the renewed strength of Scottish nationalists and Catalan separatists--suggests that many Europeans yearn for more self-determination. One way the EU could respond is by accommodating, rather than blocking, the emergence of small independent nations that might see closer ties with Brussels as a form of freedom from overbearing national capitals. Such a future would certainly fit within McNamara\'s vision of a more politically active, participatory Europe.This possibility was derided after the interwar years as a recipe for conflict and instability. Indeed, it was to defend Europe from the threat of various nationalisms and regionalisms that Monnet developed his concept of a European federation. In reality, however, the growth of the EU has gone hand in hand with demands for autonomy within it. Indeed, the EU has itself made such demands plausible: Scots would likely find the idea of secession from the United Kingdom far less attractive if there were no EU for an independent Scotland to join. The problem for the EU is that if it were to accept Scotland as a member, the Basques, the Catalans, and others would soon line up to be next, opening the floodgates to secessionism. This is not something major powers in the EU will permit.The EU, far from being drawn together, has been split down the middle. A second possible future would see the reinforcing of Germany\'s de facto hegemony within the EU. France and Italy are declining in influence and economic power, and the United Kingdom is not a eurozone member, so Germany has become ever more powerful as the core of the EU. This observation is curiously absent from McNamara\'s book. German leadership is driving European integration forward, providing the resources to ensure that the EU succeeds, even as the resolve of other member states weakens. Yet for many states, the eurozone crisis underscored the threat of unchecked German influence. As Bill Cash, the chair of the British Parliament\'s European Scrutiny Committee, put it recently, "The European Union has morphed into an increasingly undemocratic German-dominated Europe." As a result, countries have become less interested in a European federation, even as they continue to follow EU rules and regulations. And poorer, smaller nations understandably fear a union whose stability would depend on a German chancellor\'s self-restraint.A third future for Europe hinges on the continent\'s changing demographics. Crucially, Europe\'s low birthrates and aging populations have created a need for immigrant labor. In 2014, the Organ-ization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the European Commission reported that Europe\'s working-age population is projected to decline by 7.5 million between 2013 and 2020, and in a scenario of zero net immigration, it could decline by up to 11.7 million. The continent is suffering from a shortage of skilled labor just as it needs most to compete globally for talent. Meanwhile, Europe has been flooded by what the OECD calls "an unprecedented number of asylum seekers and refugees," which includes 350,000 to 450,000 people who "could be granted refugee or similar status, more than in any previous European refugee crisis since World War II."Europe is quickly becoming one of the most diverse regions of the world. Germany now has the third-highest number of immigrants of any country, according to the United Nations, and more than 16 million of its 81 million people are of foreign or immigrant descent. The United Kingdom has the second-highest number of immigrants in the EU after Germany. As these and other European economies continue to grow, so, too, will their demand for foreign workers. Put another way, Europe will become more like the United States, since immigration will be unstoppable (geopolitically) and necessary (demographically and economically). This might make further European integration easier as old national identities become ever more porous. Countries looking for social cohesion may well turn to a broader European identity, one tied together by the "labels, mental maps, and narratives" McNamara describes. In the short term, however, it is precisely this prospect that fuels opposition to both immigration and further European integration.The most likely future of the EU is ongoing cooperation under German leadership. Whether this is to be feared will depend largely on domestic politics within Germany, as well as on the willingness of Europe\'s larger players to keep Germany focused on (and constrained by) the mutual benefits of the union. In the longer term, politics within Germany (and all the other European nations) will shift as its population changes. A more diverse Europe will alter the politics within each country and may ultimately make the case for greater integration easier.The idea of European federation promised peace within Europe\'s borders and global influence beyond them. But Europe is not on the path toward that future. The eurozone crisis has cracked the foundations of European integration. European countries have successfully cooperated over the past six decades and are likely to continue to do so, under an umbrella of Germany hegemony. Paradoxically, ever-strengthening German leadership simultaneously facilitates cooperation and repels further integration. The result will be a Europe that continues to use, but does not fully exploit, its collective political and economic weight in the world. blank'

S'At the end of September, Russia began conducting air strikes in Syria, ostensibly to combat terrorist groups. The strikes constitute Russia\'s biggest intervention in the Middle East in decades. Its unanticipated military foray into Syria has transformed the civil war there into a proxy U.S.-Russian conflict and has raised the stakes in the ongoing standoff between Moscow and Washington. It has also succeeded in diverting attention away from Russia\'s destabilization of Ukraine, making it impossible for the West to continue to isolate the Kremlin. Russia is now a player in the Syrian crisis, and the United States will have to find a way to deal with it.Once again, Washington has been caught off-guard, just as it was in March 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and began supporting pro-Russian separatists fighting Ukrainian forces in eastern Ukraine. For all of Russia\'s domestic problems--a shrinking economy, a declining population, and high rates of capital flight and brain drain--it has projected a surprising amount of power not only in its neighborhood but also beyond. U.S. President Barack Obama may refer to Russia as a regional power, but Russia\'s military intervention in Syria demonstrates that it once again intends to be accepted as a global actor and play a part in every major international decision. This will be a vexing challenge not only for Obama during his remaining time in office but also for the next occupant of the White House.Why has Washington been so slow to grasp the new Russian reality? Russian President Vladimir Putin has not kept his agenda a secret. In February 2007, for example, he delivered a scathing critique of U.S. foreign policy at the Munich Security Conference. "One state and, of course, first and foremost the United States, has overstepped its national borders in every way," he warned. Countless times since, Russia has vowed to replace what it sees as a coercive U.S.-led global order with one in which the West respects Russia\'s interests. In retrospect, Russia\'s war with Georgia in August 2008 signaled Moscow\'s willingness to use force to prevent its neighbors from drifting toward the West and to reassert its influence in areas that were formerly part of the Soviet Union. But the United States and its allies have repeatedly underestimated Russia\'s determination to revise the global order that Moscow feels the West has imposed on Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union.As the United States gears up for the 2016 presidential election, it faces two central challenges in deciding how to deal with Russia. First, it needs to determine the nature of Russia\'s objectives in Syria and Ukraine. Second, because Russia depends on a highly personalized political system, Obama and his would-be successors need to decide how to manage relations with Putin, an especially difficult task given the overwhelming pressure on the campaign trail to look tough. The evidence suggests that if the next president wants to engage with the Kremlin in a way that is consistent with U.S. interests, he or she should focus on concrete areas where the two countries can and must work together--particularly nuclear and conventional military issues. Continuing to isolate Russia is not likely to work. Instead, the next U.S. administration should clearly communicate to the Kremlin what American interests and values are and join with U.S. allies in resisting further Russian attempts to unravel the post-Cold War order.INFERIORITY COMPLEXOver the past quarter century, Moscow and Washington have worked together most successfully when Moscow has felt that it has been treated as an equal. This explains the success, for example, of U.S.-Russian arms control treaties, such as New START, which were designed to deal with the nuclear legacy of the Cold War. Similarly, although the negotiations were arduous and drawn out, Russia and the United States successfully worked together, alongside four other world powers, to reach a nuclear deal with Iran. Indeed, Putin earned rare praise from Obama for his role in securing the agreement.The United States has been unable to create a post-Cold War security architecture in which Russia feels it has a stake.Moscow and Washington have also been able to work together in instances in which they shared narrowly defined common interests. In the fall of 2001, for example, Russia aided the United States in its initial military campaign in Afghanistan, providing information and intelligence that contributed to the U.S. defeat of the Taliban. As Russia\'s former foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, subsequently explained, "We wanted an antiterrorist international coalition like the anti-Nazi coalition. This would be the basis for a new world order."    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display("dfp-ad-x90_2");    });  That rather lofty goal has remained predictably out of reach. And in fact, Russia and the United States have had difficulty maintaining their counterterrorist cooperation, largely because they often disagree on which groups to designate as terrorist organizations--a problem that has cropped up most recently in regard to the various Syrian opposition groups. Nevertheless, Russia and the United States have been able to cooperate on other security issues, working together in 2013, for example, to eliminate the Assad regime\'s stockpile of chemical weapons. In that instance, Russia took the initiative after the United States proved reluctant to act.Cooperation has been least successful on issues involving Russia\'s neighboring states and the NATO alliance. It has become clear that despite the West\'s numerous efforts in the 1990s to reassure Russia that an enlarged NATO would not represent a threat to Moscow, the United States and its allies have been unable to create a post-Cold War security architecture in which Russia feels that it has a stake. Perhaps doing so would have been impossible, especially given Russia\'s belief in its right to a sphere of "privileged interests" in the post-Soviet space and its desire to limit its neighbors\' sovereignty. The wars in Georgia and Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea have represented, in part, Russia\'s answer to its perceived exclusion from the post-Cold War European security order. The same sense of grievance explains Putin\'s ongoing push to establish a new arrangement among the great powers that would give Russia more leverage on matters of European security. Specifically, Putin seeks an agreement that would ensure that no additional post-Soviet states will join NATO.PUTIN\'S BIG MOVEPutin\'s decision to intervene militarily in Syria is rooted in similar concerns about Russian power and influence. Russia has justified its foray into Syria as part of an effort to reduce terrorism by shoring up the Assad regime, which by the summer of 2015 was facing military setbacks. As Putin said in October, "The collapse of Syria\'s official authorities will only mobilize terrorists. Right now, instead of undermining them, we must revive them, strengthening state institutions in the conflict zone." Although Moscow may not be wedded to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the long run, it is adamantly opposed to anything that would weaken the rule of secular strongmen in the Middle East--hence Putin\'s repeated denunciations of U.S. support for opposition forces during the Arab revolts of 2011 and his anger over the NATO military action against Libya that year, which led to the ouster of Libyan dictator Muammar al-Qaddafi. In Putin\'s eyes, the disorder in Iraq, Syria, and North Africa, combined with the rise of the self-proclaimed Islamic State (also known as ISIS), demonstrates the failure of the West to think through the consequences of undermining the authoritarian states in the region. Putin fears that chaos in the Middle East will strengthen Islamic extremism on Russia\'s borders, in the neighboring states of the former Soviet Union, and potentially in Russia itself.  Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation / Handout via ReutersA frame grab taken from footage released by Russia\'s Defence Ministry shows air strikes carried out by Russia\'s air force in Syria, November 2015.At the same time, Russia\'s actions are designed to guarantee that Moscow will have a decisive say in who rules Syria, even in a hypothetical post-Assad future. By using military force in Syria, Moscow is sending a message to other regional players: unlike the United States, Russia will support leaders and governments against popular uprisings and will not desert them when opposition groups attempt to seize control, as the United States abandoned Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in 2011.The Syrian gambit is thus part of a broader move to recoup Russian influence in the Middle East. In the second half of 2015, the leaders of Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates all visited Moscow, and some have signed agreements to purchase arms from Russia. In July, Saudi Arabia pledged to invest up to $10 billion in Russia, mostly in agricultural projects; if Riyadh delivers on that promise, it will be the single largest foreign investment in the country. Israel and Russia have maintained a steady dialogue as the crisis has progressed in Syria, partly to ensure that Russian aircraft don\'t clash with the Israeli jets that have occasionally struck targets in Syria, including those associated with the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah, which has sent thousands of fighters to Syria to aid the Assad regime. Although the Israelis have no particular affection for Assad, they seem to share Russia\'s preference that his regime stay in place, because what comes after Assad could be more detrimental to Israel\'s security: Israeli officials have quietly pointed out that under Assad\'s rule, Israel\'s border with Syria has been calm.Domestic political factors also contribute to Putin\'s calculations. The sanctions that the United States and the EU levied against Russia after its annexation of Crimea have hit hard, especially when combined with the global fall in oil prices and preexisting structural problems in the Russian economy. The Kremlin has sought relief by "freezing" the conflict in the Donbas region of Ukraine--a cease-fire between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists has been in force since early September, and both sides have pulled back some of their heavy weaponry, although sporadic reports of fighting have surfaced since then. Putin has calculated that the cease-fire and the decision by pro-Russian separatists to postpone local elections in eastern Ukraine may lead to the partial lifting of EU sanctions. Moreover, by making the Ukraine crisis appear to be headed toward resolution, Russia intends to shift the focus from its role as an instigator of conflict to its new role in Syria as a responsible leader in the global campaign against terrorism.Russia has presented its intervention in Syria as a counterterrorist operation that will reduce the number of refugees leaving Syria for Europe. But Moscow\'s policy could have the opposite effect. In fact, by November, there had already been a 26 percent increase in the number of Syrian refugees, according to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, further exacerbating Europe\'s migrant crisis. The Russian bombing campaign may have contributed to the upsurge in refugees. Moreover, Russian air strikes in support of the Alawite-led Assad government--which Sunni extremists consider to be an apostate regime--may both encourage more Russians to join ISIS (more than 4,000 people from Russia and Central Asia have already done so) and further alienate Russia\'s own Sunni population, which numbers about 20 million. Putin has insisted that Russia has no interest in taking sides in a sectarian dispute and is merely fighting extremism, but this may be a hard sell domestically, as some Russian Muslims question Russia\'s support of a regime that bombs its Sunni population. And Russia has not acknowledged that the Assad regime\'s brutal treatment of its own population is a recruiting tool for ISIS.Although it is tempting to search for a broader strategy behind Russian military activity in Syria, it\'s quite possible that Putin charged into the conflict without thinking through the endgame.Putin\'s intervention in Syria has sent a mixed message. On the one hand, he has blamed the United States for creating the conditions that allowed ISIS to emerge; on the other, he has offered to join the United States in an anti-ISIS coalition. In remarks last October, Putin said, "Syria can become a model for partnership in the name of common interests, resolving problems that affect everyone, and developing an effective risk-management system." Yet unlike in Afghanistan in 2001, Moscow and Washington do not agree on the identity of the enemy. Although they both see ISIS as a major threat, Russia has bombed Syrian opposition groups that the United States has supported, and Washington sees Assad\'s rule as a major part of the country\'s problems. Thanks to these differences, it will be difficult for Russia and the United States to work together in Syria.Until recently, Washington\'s preferred policy was to avoid clashes in Syrian airspace, cautiously increase the presence of the U.S. military on the ground, observe Russian actions from the sidelines, and wait to see whether Russia would get pulled into a quagmire. But the November 13 terrorist attacks in Paris may have changed Washington\'s calculations and given new impetus to joint U.S.-Russian efforts to deal with Syria and ISIS. At the G-20 summit in Turkey soon after the attacks, Obama and Putin agreed to support a cease-fire in Syria and intensify diplomatic attempts to end the civil war. At the very least, Putin has succeeded in getting Washington to engage more closely with Russia and abandon policies aimed at isolating it.If part of Putin\'s main goal in Syria is to force Washington to recognize Russia\'s importance in the Middle East, it is worth asking whether Putin sees that recognition as an end in itself or as an initial step toward a tripolar world in which China, Russia, and the United States make the major decisions--a cherished aspiration of some Russian pundits. On the other hand, although it is tempting to search for a broader strategy behind Russian military activity in Syria, it\'s quite possible that Putin charged into the conflict without thinking through the endgame.GETTING REAL ABOUT RUSSIAFor the remainder of Obama\'s second term, tensions over Syria and Ukraine will dominate U.S.-Russian relations. The best that can be achieved in Ukraine in the near term is a "frozen conflict" in which the cease-fire holds even though Kiev remains unable to control the Donbas region and Russia continues to exercise influence there through its proxies. The most the United States is likely to do is continue its modest economic and political support for the Ukrainian government, which is struggling to address systemic problems of corruption and economic disorder. Although some in the U.S. government have argued for more economic and military assistance to Ukraine--including the provision of lethal defensive weapons--the White House has consistently refused to do this for fear of further provoking Russia, and it is unlikely to change its policy in 2016.Meanwhile, it will be a continuing challenge for Moscow and Washington to work together in Syria to combat ISIS. But short of more robust and direct U.S. military engagement--for which there is little domestic support after the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq--Washington has limited options. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has spearheaded discussions with Russia and other key players, including Iran and Saudi Arabia, on how to end the Syrian civil war and transition away from an Assad-led government. Russia and the United States will continue to work together in this way, but securing agreement on a post-Assad Syria will be a major challenge. Direct military cooperation in Syria is highly unlikely, meaning that there are few prospects for Russia and the United States to work together other than on making sure their respective military operations stay out of the other\'s way.  Lucy Nicholson / ReutersSyrian-Americans protest Russian intervention in Syria outside a Russian consular office in Santa Monica, California, October 2015.Even if the United States finds an effective way to respond to Russia\'s moves in Syria, or even cooperate with the Russians there, there is no guarantee that Putin won\'t try to assert Russia\'s military presence elsewhere: he has surprised the West twice in recent years and may yet have other ambitions. Iraq has hinted that it may ask Russia for help in fighting ISIS. When asked in October about whether Russia would intervene in Iraq, Putin replied that Russia had not yet received a request from Baghdad. Russia has also indicated that it will not stand by if the situation in Afghanistan deteriorates further, as this would threaten Russia\'s neighborhood by destabilizing Central Asia.  The next occupant of the White House will have to define U.S. interests in Syria and Ukraine; determine the extent to which Washington should counter destabilizing Russian moves in those countries and elsewhere; decide when and where the United States should cooperate with Russia; and consider, as U.S. options become more limited because of shrinking resources and public opinion, whether the West is ready to acknowledge that Moscow has in fact succeeded in modifying the rules of the game in its favor in both Syria and Ukraine.Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, four U.S. presidents have tried to "reset" relations with Russia and find a more productive way to interact with Moscow, and each attempt has ultimately failed. Russia has not evolved in the way the West believed it would in the 1990s: the United States has to deal with the Russia that exists, not the one Americans might wish for. Indeed, for the foreseeable future, Washington should expect the U.S.-Russian relationship to be defined by tension and antagonism rather than cooperation.The next U.S. president should not attempt another reset. He or she should work with Russia on issues on which Moscow and Washington share clearly delineated common goals, in Syria and elsewhere. Issues the two countries can work on together include keeping nuclear weapons from Iran and North Korea and managing emerging resource and security issues in the Arctic. But the next president should also clearly define and defend U.S. interests and accept that so long as the Kremlin continues to portray the United States as its main enemy, dedicated to weakening Russia and the primary source of all its troubles, common action on shared goals will be shaky and elusive.

S'In one of the most riveting and heartfelt books to appear in some time, Coates reflects on the state of black America in the form of a letter to his adolescent son. For Coates, the American dream is so grounded in racism that the "people who need to believe they are white" today are almost as deeply involved in the destruction of black bodies and black lives as their forebears were. Coates\' writing is powered by his outrage at the recent string of police shootings of young black men, which have gone largely unpunished, and intensified by his visceral fear for the safety of his own son in a country where such incidents are widespread. The book achieves a level of clarity and eloquence reminiscent of Ralph Ellison\'s classic Invisible Man; it is compelling even when it isn\'t entirely convincing. Coates may be a better polemicist than analyst, but the perspective he brings to American life is one that no responsible citizen or serious scholar can safely ignore. blank'

S'In a sense, the debate between Burke and his antagonists--between conservatism and radicalism, broadly defined--has shaped political debate in the Western world since the late eighteenth century. Burke himself has become known as "the father of modern conservatism." But David Bromwich is not fond of that phrase. "No serious historian today would repeat the commonplace that Burke was the father of modern conservatism," writes the esteemed scholar of literature in his magnificent, beautifully written new study of the first half of Burke\'s career, which is the most notable addition to a recent crop of books about Burke. The trouble is not only that the line between Burke and modern conservatism is hardly straight but also that Burke\'s legacy is far too complex to be captured by any such phrase. Anyone hoping to understand Burke is confronted with an array of historians and philosophers of aesthetics, politics, and political theory; social conservatives and free-market liberals; and even closet radicals--all claiming that they hold the key to the "real" Burke.

S"Thomas has written a good old-fashioned British history. It is supremely erudite, eminently readable, and politically incorrect. The topic is the Spanish empire of the late sixteenth century, which Thomas argues was the first global (and thus the first modern) empire. He focuses on the gruesome nature of Spanish conquests in Mexico, South America, and the Philippines, during which individuals of dubious, often criminal backgrounds used brutal means (including enslavement) to realize not just the Spanish royal will but also their own goals. Those goals--seeking treasure, establishing independent kingdoms, and even, in one case, conquering China--sometimes crossed over into the fantastical, if not the outright insane. At the heart of it all sat Philip II, reading every document, holding the empire together through personal rule, and authorizing massive expenditures that ultimately bankrupted his kingdom. But then comes Thomas' politically incorrect punch line: despite these lurid details, he defends the civilizing mission of the Spanish empire as ultimately progressive. This seems odd, but in an era when Western armies are engaged in their own civilizing missions throughout the world, Westerners would do well to study what their ancestors did when faced with similar challenges. blank"

S'When it comes to wealth and income, people tend to compare themselves to the people they see around them rather than to those who live on the other side of the world. The average Frenchman, for example, probably does not care how many Chinese exceed his own standard of living, but that Frenchman surely would pay attention if he started lagging behind his fellow citizens. Yet when thinking about inequality, it also makes sense to approach the world as a single community: accounting, for example, not only for the differences in living standards within France but also for those between rich French people and poor Chinese (and poor French and rich Chinese).When looking at the world through this lens, some notable trends stand out. The first is that global inequality greatly exceeds inequality within any individual country. This observation should come as no surprise, since global inequality reflects the enormous differences in wealth between the world\'s richest and the world\'s poorest countries, not just the differences within them. Much more striking is the fact that, in a dramatic reversal of the trend that prevailed for most of the twentieth century, global inequality has declined markedly since 2000 (following a slower decline during the 1990s). This trend has been due in large part to the rising fortunes of the developing world, particularly China and India. And as the economies of these countries continue to converge with those of the developed world, global inequality will continue to fall for some time.Even as global inequality has declined, however, inequality within individual countries has crept upward. There is some disagreement about the size of this increase among economists, largely owing to the underrepresentation of wealthy people in national income surveys. But whatever its extent, increased inequality within individual countries has partially offset the decline in inequality among countries. To counteract this trend, states should pursue policies aimed at redistributing income, strengthen the regulation of the labor and financial markets, and develop international arrangements that prevent firms from avoiding taxes by shifting their assets or operations overseas.THE GREAT SUBSTITUTIONEconomists typically measure income inequality using the Gini coefficient, which ranges from zero in cases of perfect equality (a theoretical country in which everyone earns the same income) to one in cases of perfect inequality (a state in which a single individual earns all the income and everyone else gets nothing). In continental Europe, Gini coefficients tend to fall between 0.25 and 0.30. In the United States, the figure is around 0.40. And in the world\'s most unequal countries, such as South Africa, it exceeds 0.60. When considering the world\'s population as a whole, the Gini coefficient comes to 0.70--a figure so high that no country is known to have ever reached it.  Pascal Fletcher / REUTERSA Nigerian family walks past a newly opened supermarket in Kano, Nigeria, April 2014.Determining the Gini coefficient for global inequality requires making a number of simplifications and assumptions. Economists must accommodate gaps in domestic data--in Mexico, an extreme case, surveys of income and expenditures miss about half of all households. They need to come up with estimates for years in which national surveys are not available. They need to convert local incomes into a common currency, usually the U.S. dollar, and correct for differences in purchasing power. And they need to adjust for discrepancies in data collection among countries, such as those that arise when one state measures living standards by income and another by consumption per person or when a state does not collect data at all.Such inexactitudes and the different ways of compensating for them explain why estimates of just how much global inequality has declined over the past two-plus decades tend to vary--from around two percentage points to up to five, depending on the study. No matter how steep this decline, however, economists generally agree that the end result has been a global Gini coefficient of around 0.70 in the years between 2008 and 2010.The decline in global inequality is largely the product of the convergence of the economies of developing countries, particularly China and India, with those of the developed world. In the first decade of this century, booming economies in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa also helped accelerate this trend. Remarkably, this decline followed a nearly uninterrupted rise in inequality from the advent of the Industrial Revolution in the early nineteenth century until the 1970s. What is more, the decline has been large enough to erase a substantial part of the inequality that built up over that century and a half.Even as inequality among countries has decreased, however, inequality within individual countries has increased, gaining, on average, more than two percentage points in terms of the Gini coefficient between 1990 and 2010. The countries with the biggest economies are especially responsible for this trend--particularly the United Sates, where the Gini coefficient rose by five percentage points between 1990 and 2013, but also China and India and, to a lesser extent, most European countries, among them Germany and the Scandinavian states. Still, inequality within countries is not rising fast enough to offset the rapid decline in inequality among countries.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display("dfp-ad-x90_2");    });  In a dramatic reversal of the trend that prevailed for most of the twentieth century, global inequality has declined markedly since 2000.The good news is that the current decline in global inequality will probably persist. Despite the current global slowdown, China and India have such huge domestic markets that they retain an enormous amount of potential for growth. And even if their growth rates decline significantly in the next decade, so long as they remain higher than those of the advanced industrial economies, as is likely, global inequality will continue to fall. The prospects for growth are less favorable for the smaller economies in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa that depend primarily on commodity exports, since world commodity prices may remain low for some time. All told, then, global inequality will likely keep falling in the coming decades--but probably at the slow pace seen during the 1990s rather than the rapid one enjoyed during the following decade.  STR / AFP / GETTY IMAGES  Scavenging in a garbage dump in Hefei, China, December 2012.          The bad news, however, is that economists might have underestimated inequality within individual countries and the extent to which it has increased since the 1990s, because national surveys tend to underrepresent the wealthy and underreport income derived from property, which disproportionately accrues to the rich. Indeed, tax data from many developed states suggest that national surveys fail to account for a substantial portion of the incomes of the very highest earners.According to the most drastic corrections for such underreporting, as calculated by the economists Sudhir Anand and Paul Segal, global inequality could have remained more or less constant between 1988 and 2005. Most likely, however, this conclusion is too extreme, and the increase in national inequality has been too small to cancel out the decline in inequality among countries. Yet it still points to a disheartening trend: increased inequality within countries has offset the drop in inequality among countries. In other words, the gap between average Americans and average Chinese is being partly replaced by larger gaps between rich and poor Americans and between rich and poor Chinese.INTERCONNECTED AND UNEQUALThe same factor that can be credited for the decline in inequality among countries can also be blamed for the increase in inequality within them: globalization. As firms from the developed world moved production overseas during the 1990s, emerging Asian economies, particularly China, started to converge with those of the developed world. The resulting boom triggered faster growth in Africa and Latin America as demand for commodities increased. In the developed world, meanwhile, as manufacturing firms outsourced some of their production, corporate profits rose but real wages for unskilled labor fell.Economic liberalization also played an important role in this process. In China, the market reforms initiated by Deng Xiaoping in the 1980s contributed just as much to rapid growth as did the country\'s opening to foreign investment and trade, and the same is true of the reforms India undertook in the early 1990s. As with globalization, such reforms didn\'t just enable developing countries to get closer to the developed world; they also created a new elite within those countries while leaving many citizens behind, thus increasing domestic inequality.Economists might have underestimated inequality within individual countries and the extent to which it has increased since the 1990s.The same drive toward economic liberalization has contributed to increasing inequality in the developed world. Reductions in income tax rates, cuts to welfare, and financial deregulation have also helped make the rich richer and, in some instances, the poor poorer. The increase in the international mobility of firms, wealth, and workers over the past two decades has compounded these problems by making it harder for governments to combat inequality: for example, companies and wealthy people have become increasingly able to shift capital to countries with low tax rates or to tax havens, allowing them to avoid paying more redistributive taxes in their home countries. And in both developed and developing countries, technological progress has exacerbated these trends by favoring skilled workers over unskilled ones and creating economies of scale that disproportionately favor corporate managers.MAINTAINING MOMENTUMIn the near future, the greatest potential for further reductions in global inequality will lie in Africa--the region that has arguably benefited the least from the past few decades of globalization, and the one where global poverty will likely concentrate in the coming decades as countries such as India leap ahead. Perhaps most important, the population of Africa is expected to double over the next 35 years, reaching some 25 percent of the world\'s population, and so the extent of global inequality will increasingly depend on the extent of African growth. Assuming that the economies of sub-Saharan Africa sustain the modest growth rates they have seen in recent years, then inequality among countries should keep declining, although not as fast as it did in the first decade of this century.    ERIC THAYER / REUTERSAn Armani store in New York, February 2009.To maintain the momentum behind declining global inequality, all countries will need to work harder to reduce inequality within their borders, or at least prevent it from growing further. In the world\'s major economies, failing to do so could cause disenchanted citizens to misguidedly resist further attempts to integrate the world\'s economies--a process that, if properly managed, can in fact benefit everyone.In practice, then, states should seek to equalize living standards among their populations by eliminating all types of ethnic, gender, and social discrimination; regulating the financial and labor markets; and implementing progressive taxation and welfare policies. Because the mobility of capital dulls the effectiveness of progressive taxation policies, governments also need to push for international measures that improve the transparency of the financial system, such as those the G-20 and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have endorsed to share information among states in order to clamp down on tax avoidance. Practical steps such as these should remind policymakers that even though global inequality and domestic inequality have moved in opposite directions for the past few decades, they need not do so forever.

S'There has been much discussion of rising economic inequality in the developed world recently, along with a generalized sense that the problem has grown to intolerable proportions. But at the same time, there has been little movement to address the situation; instead, there is tacit acceptance of many specific forms of inequality and the processes that produce it. The result is widespread discontent together with practical passivity.One might call this a Bossuet paradox, after the seventeenth-century theologian Jacques-Benigne Bossuet, who said, "God laughs at men who complain of the consequences while cherishing the causes." Today, people deplore inequality in general, appalled by broad social statistics or extreme examples of wealth and poverty, but often consent to it in particular, regarding smaller variations in life outcomes as the result of presumptively legitimate individual choices and circumstances. A recent survey conducted in France on the "perception of inequality and feelings of injustice," for example, found that nearly 90 percent of respondents thought income disparities should be reduced, and an even larger percentage felt that a just society ought to guarantee the fulfillment of everyone\'s basic needs (for education, food, health care, and shelter). Yet 57 percent also felt that income inequalities were inevitable in a dynamic economy, and 85 percent said that income differences were acceptable when they rewarded individual merits.This situation is the product of a strong general moral revulsion at excessive inequality combined with a weak consensus on the theoretical grounds for acting to reduce it. Some might think the latter means that nothing can or will be done about the problem. But during the early and middle decades of the twentieth century, Western governments managed to reduce inequality dramatically, even without a shared vision on the need to do so. They were driven by three objective factors instead: fear that lack of reform would cause social and political turmoil, the practical impacts of the two world wars, and a decline in the belief in individual responsibility for people\'s destinies. Together, these led to policies such as social insurance, a minimum wage, a strong welfare state, and a progressive income tax, all of which helped make economies and societies more egalitarian.In recent decades, however, all these objective factors have disappeared, and with them, the support for egalitarian public policy. Those concerned with combating rising inequality today, therefore, have to start at the theoretical level first, formulating a conceptual framework that justifies such efforts on their own merits.WHAT DROVE THE AGE OF EQUALITYThe growth of workers\' movements in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, together with the advent of universal suffrage, presented Western elites with a difficult choice: accept a fiscal revolution or risk a social one. In the most famous example, the conservative chancellor Otto von Bismarck pioneered the modern welfare state in imperial Germany, trying to counter the spread of socialist ideas by showing government concern for the working class. After 1918, fears of revolution increased, thanks to the communist seizure of power in Russia and the spread of copycat uprisings across Europe. The ravages of the Great Depression only contributed to the problem, as did the persistent fear of communism in the decades after World War II. The result was a reformism of fear, with reduction in inequality becoming a major government priority.The experience of World War I also produced a new vision of the social bond tying countries together. In a sense, the war "nationalized" people\'s lives. Just as it threatened everyone\'s existence, so it fostered the idea everyone owed a debt to the broader community. Millions of deaths across the European continent, moreover, compelled people to think in new ways about what united them. "If the war didn\'t happen to kill you it was bound to start you thinking," George Orwell put it. Of course, the soldier\'s lot was the hardest. Each combatant learned in the mud of the trenches that his life was just as vulnerable as that of his comrade. As one of them wrote, "The consciousness of a community of nature gave rise to a very vivid and comforting sentiment of equality." And the war contributed to the growth of common national identities. As the German writer Robert Musil remarked, "Many German soldiers felt for the first time the exalting sense of having something in common with all other Germans. One suddenly became a simple, humble particle in an event that transcended the personal. Subsumed in the nation, one could almost feel it."Even the United States emerged from the war profoundly changed. The experience revolutionized American attitudes toward taxation and redistribution. When the War Revenue Act of 1917 was passed, there was talk of "conscription of income" and "conscription of wealth" at a time when young men were enlisting en masse. "Let their dollars die for their country too," one congressman said. The call for fiscal patriotism helped legitimate the progressive income tax in the United States, and by 1944, the top marginal rate had risen as high as 94 percent.The experience of World War I produced a new vision of the social bond tying countries together.In the United Kingdom and continental Europe, meanwhile, an intellectual and moral revolution helped make redistribution possible: the economy and society were "de-individualized" by thinkers who rejected older views of individual responsibility and talent. The idea of a society composed of sovereign, self-sufficient individuals gave way to an approach based on interdependence. "The isolated man does not exist," argued the French politician Leon Bourgeois, and the British philosopher L. T. Hobhouse argued similarly that every individual was shaped by the "social atmosphere" around him.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display("dfp-ad-x90_2");    });  In this new context, the notions of right and duty, merit and responsibility, and autonomy and solidarity were completely redefined. During the nineteenth century, the core of the social question had focused on personal responsibility. The key activity of the state and charitable institutions was considered to be distinguishing the "deserving poor," whose condition derived from purely external circumstances, from the "undeserving poor," whose problems were caused by their own misconduct and bad habits. The former should be supported, it was thought, but the latter had to be punished (say, by being put in a workhouse) or simply abandoned to their fate.By the middle decades of the twentieth century, in contrast, individual behavior was no longer seen as the driver of social outcomes; rather, the reverse was believed to be true. Poverty was the consequence, rather than the cause, of social dysfunctions, and the welfare state acted universally, behind a "veil of ignorance." From unemployment to disease or disability, the problems of citizens were seen as risks largely beyond individual control, with governments required to step in and manage those risks collectively through broad programs of social insurance.These changed attitudes about individual responsibility were accompanied by a new approach to economic performance. Instead of celebrating entrepreneurs and innovation as the factors driving economic growth, mid-twentieth-century intellectuals emphasized the roles of managers and organizations. Writers such as Peter Drucker, John Kenneth Galbraith, and Andrew Shonfield exemplified in their work a new and influential approach to corporations. "In the mature enterprise," Galbraith wrote in 1967, ". . . power has passed, inevitably and irrevocably, from the individual to the group. That is because only the group has the information that decision requires." Schumpeter was passe: "The entrepreneur no longer exists as an individual person in the mature industrial enterprise"; he had been replaced by the "technostructure," a collective mind. Success depended more on the quality of a firm\'s organization and the efficiency of its management than on the exceptional talents of particular individuals, even at the top of the corporate pyramid: "Retirement, death and replacement [of a CEO] . . . have no perceptible effect on the performance of General Motors or IBM."Within such an economic paradigm, economic efficiency was seen as a collective achievement. No one could claim the accomplishments of a company as his own. Executives were better paid than workers, but only within the framework of a functional hierarchy of skills. The management guru Drucker argued that the pay ratio between the top executive and the humblest worker in a company should be no greater than 20 to 1.THE CONTEMPORARY CHALLENGEThe combination of these trends created a political and intellectual basis for policies that redistributed wealth and reduced economic inequality across the advanced industrial democracies throughout the middle decades of the twentieth century, even without any theoretical consensus about justice or equality. Over the past few decades, however, each of these trends has been reversed.After the collapse of communism, there was no longer a need for a reformism of fear. The era of revolutions, in the classical sense of the term, is now over. Social fears still exist, but they concern such things as immigration, security, and terrorism. They appeal to an authoritarian state, not a solidaristic one. Most of the countries heavily involved in the two world wars, meanwhile, have long since entered a period of peace, and their senses of a national community as an expression of a mutual debt and common destiny have been weakened. Welfare states have entered a period of deep crisis, both for financial reasons and because the notion of social risk has been eroded by a renewed belief in individual responsibility as a constitutive element of social life. And a new kind of capitalism has replaced the style of firms described by Drucker and Galbraith. Schumpe-terian entrepreneurs and innovators have roared back to the fore of economic life, with individual performance and personal responsibility celebrated everywhere as central to success and efficiency.What this means is that there are no longer strong exogenous factors driving developed countries toward policies that keep inequality in check--and unsurprisingly, in the absence of those factors, such policies have eroded, contributing to the rise in inequality everyone has noticed. If inequality is to be reduced once more, therefore, the effort will have to be grounded in a solid, shared conception of what equality involves and why it is worth promoting.Welfare states have entered a period of deep crisis, for financial reasons and because the notion of social risk has been eroded by a renewed belief in individual responsibility.There are two main contenders today for such a conception. One, the populist option, redefines equality as social identity or homogeneity. The other, the social-liberal option, emphasizes equality of opportunity. Both have flaws.The populist option was first developed in Europe during the late nineteenth century, in an earlier era of intensive globalization. It could also be labeled as "national protectionism," and it should be understood as a solidaristic alternative to unbridled capitalism. It is sustained by a purely negative definition of equality, forming a community of some by excluding others. The French activist Maurice Barrs put it bluntly: "The idea of \'fatherland\' implies a kind of inequality, but to the detriment of foreigners." In a new era of intensive globalization, with economic stagnation among the middle and lower classes in developed countries and the welfare state in crisis, such xenophobic views are returning on both sides of the Atlantic as a powerful political force, with outsiders--foreigners, immigrants, refugees--portrayed as enemies exploiting and undermining existing national communities.  Jean-Paul Pelissier / ReutersEmployees of the National Agency for Employment demonstrate in Marseille, November 2009. The banner reads "Strike".The social-liberal option, in contrast, seeks to update and extend the traditional liberal notion of equality of opportunity, going beyond the classical negative definition of it (the elimination of barriers to upward mobility) to incorporate broader positive efforts to achieve the same underlying goal. Different avenues for activism have been suggested, linked by their common desire to block the mechanisms through which economic, social, and cultural inequalities are reproduced from generation to generation. They generally involve some sort of redistribution--of cash, of goods, of privilege, of social capital, and so forth. They all seek to equalize the conditions in which individuals compete in a fair contest for meritocratic rewards.The vigorous implementation of all these positive variants of equality of opportunity, however, raises problems. To be treated as true equals, individuals would need to be "desocialized"--separated from their families, their inheritances, and their personal contexts. That implementation could also lead to a hierarchical and depressing society, one in which everyone\'s life outcome would be determined, following his desocialization, soley by his personal attributes and efforts. Such a meritocracy could well be a harsh and unforgiving society, one in which individuals must internalize their despair over any problems they encounter.The populist vision of equality, in short, is more about exclusion than inclusion and has little attractive positive content. And although the social-liberal vision lays the basis for a number of valuable practical policies, it is unsuitable for establishing a general and universal social theory of equality, since it focuses exclusively on individuals. So something more is needed, a positive theory into which the politics of equality of opportunity could be embedded.THREE PRINCIPLES FOR DEMOCRATIC EQUALITYThese days, equality is usually defined mathematically, as a comparison of the economic positions of individuals or segments of the population. This notion has its uses. But equality should also, and perhaps primarily, be defined socially, as a measure of the communal bond. A theory of equality needs to focus on the structure of society. It should rest on three principles: a recognition of people\'s singularity (as opposed to individualism), the organization of reciprocity (in the relation of citizens to one another), and the constitution of commonality (for the community as a whole).The classic modern revolutionary idea has been to abolish privilege and create a world of similar, and similarly situated, people (best expressed by the French word semblable). But similarity does not require sameness, nor does it mean lack of individuality or autonomy. Each individual can stand out by virtue of the unique qualities that he or she alone possesses, with diversity becoming the standard of equality. Each individual seeks his or her own path and control over his or her history. Everyone is similar by dint of being singular and incomparable.Equality based on singularity requires a type of society grounded in neither abstract universalism nor identity-based communitarianism but rather the dynamic construction and recognition of specificities. Singularity is not a sign of withdrawal from society (individualism as retreat or separation). Rather, it signals an expectation of reciprocity, of mutual recognition. This marks the advent of a fully democratic age: the basis of society lies not in nature but solely in a shared philosophy of equality. Democracy as a type of political regime is mirrored by democracy as a form of society.As for the relationships that singular individuals maintain with one another, Tocqueville argued that selfishness is "to societies what rust is to metal." And today, the most important source of corrosion is the absence of reciprocity. Many studies have shown that political commitment is conditional: people are more likely to contribute efforts or funds if they believe that other citizens will do the same. Conversely, any perceived disruption of reciprocity can lead to withdrawal in one form or another. Inequality is felt most acutely when citizens believe that the rules apply differently to different people. They resent double standards and those who manage to manipulate the game to their own advantage. Such sentiments are a crucial source of social distrust, which in turn undermines the legitimacy of the welfare state, fosters aversion to taxes, legitimizes various forms of self-dealing (as justifiable compensation for others\' transgressions), and erodes public spirit.A general sense that reciprocity has broken down in recent decades has fed frustrations that have been exploited by extremist political movements in many developed countries--groups that direct their fire at privileged elites and poor immigrants, both of whom are assumed to be taking advantage of the supposedly hard-working and exploited middle and working classes. Restoring reciprocity, accordingly, is a crucial first step toward creating a society of equals. Equality as reciprocity means above all equality of treatment and involvement. Abuse of the welfare and tax systems must be vigorously opposed in order to maintain confidence in these institutions, as must the provision of favors to special interests and any lack of equality or transparency in the operations of the state more generally.  Getty Images / AFP / Noel CelisWalk on: in Manila, Philippines, January 2014.  The third element required for a society of equals is the development of some sense of community for society as a whole. Civil citizenship and the notion of human rights that goes along with it have reshaped the very idea of the individual. But citizenship is also a social form. The citizen is not merely an individual endowed with certain rights; he is also defined by his relation to others, his fellow citizens. What the French linguist mile Benveniste tells us about the etymology of the word civis is especially enlightening in this regard. The Latin civis, he argued, was originally a term applied to people who shared the same habitat. Implicit in the meaning of the word was a certain idea of reciprocity. It was thus a term of relative order, as can be seen by a comparison with the root of the Sanskrit and Germanic words for "friend," "relative," and "ally." The civis was a person who joined with his peers in the construction of a civitas, a common society. I propose the term "commonality" as a name for this dimension of citizenship, citizenship as a social form, as distinct from its legal definition.Commonality is today under serious attack thanks to various forms of social separation and withdrawal. The secession of the rich into their own private havens is the most visible and shameful of these, but it is not the only one; regional separa-tism, for example, is also on the rise. The response to such withdrawals, moreover, is often an equally destructive quest for homogeneity and identity politics, the driving force behind many populist movements. What democracy needs instead is a more active, creative concept, a more complex understanding of what elements of life and experience can and should be held and lived in common.Without objective factors driving support for egalitarian policies, the only way to combat economic inequality today is to frame the quest within a broader project to create a society of equals. Neither the populist alternative of searching for comfort in a homogeneous band that excludes outsiders nor the social-liberal project of trying to achieve equality of opportunity can offer what is needed. Only a more robust vision of democratic equality--based on the singularity of individuals, reciprocal relations among them, and a social commonality--can provide the foundation for broadly accepted public policies that can attack the trends toward inequality that are hollowing out contemporary economies and polities. And only such a vision can provide guidance on how to make the necessary redistributive policies just: by seeing them as a way not simply to redress economic inequalities but also to build a society that engenders social peace and cooperation.

S'The biggest revelation offered by Ben Bernanke\'s memoir of his time as chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve is just how much the public, the media, and especially elected officials have misunderstood the real lessons of the 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent Great Recession--events that defined Bernanke\'s tenure, which began in 2006 and ended in 2014. Bernanke spends much of the book justifying what should be self-evident: that the risk of a second Great Depression called for precisely the sort of active monetary policy that he and his colleagues at the Fed pursued.As Bernanke makes clear, the crisis was a traditional financial panic of the sort that led to the creation of the Fed in the first place. Bernanke and his colleagues responded correctly to the challenge, rapidly cutting interest rates to zero and then purchasing assets, primarily U.S. Treasury bonds, on a large scale, a practice known as "quantitative easing." Both steps aided the U.S. economy by increasing credit availability, raising inflation expectations, encouraging investors to repurchase risky securities they had sold off during the initial panic, and generally restoring confidence.Anyone who reads Bernanke\'s memoir in good faith will be impressed by the depth of Bernanke\'s analysis and insight.Unfortunately, some pundits and some radical members of the U.S. Congress have distorted that fairly straightforward story, contributing to widespread but unjustified mistrust in the Fed and leading to the imposition of legal and political constraints on the central bank that will make it much harder to save the global economy the next time a financial crisis hits. Just as troubling, misguided attacks on activist monetary policy have distracted attention from the important question of how and why the financial system became so fragile in the first place. Meanwhile, the Fed\'s unwillingness and inability to preempt the panic before it spread remain unaddressed. As a result, the next time a financial crash starts, is it likely to get out of control even faster than the last one did.ARGUING WITH SUCCESSAnyone who reads The Courage to Act in good faith will be impressed by the depth of Bernanke\'s analysis and insight, to which I can attest personally, having co-authored a book on monetary policy with him in the mid-1990s. But in his memoir, as in person, Bernanke wears his erudition lightly, accessibly and concisely explaining key elements of the modern economy (such as the importance of adequate bank capital) and also illuminating relevant issues in economic history (such as why the Great Depression was so deep). Bernanke was one of the most frequently cited and influential macroeconomists in the world prior to his joining the Fed\'s Board of Governors in 2002. Without the deep understanding of the Great Depression and monetary policy that Bernanke\'s earlier academic work fostered, none of the policymakers involved in the response to the crisis would have performed as well as they did.Thus, it actually does Bernanke and other Fed officials a disservice to paint him as a uniquely heroic figure in the battle against recessionary forces; doing so minimizes just how mainstream the policies he chose actually were. Bernanke\'s preternatural calm may have helped overcome the opposition of some Fed board members and congressional overseers to significant quantitative easing. But Bernanke\'s academic work had already helped build a consensus among the overwhelming majority of mainstream macroeconomists about how to respond to financial panic. Put simply, they would have done the same thing in his position, albeit perhaps not as deftly.The extent of expert support for Bernanke\'s policies has been obscured by the almost hysterical rhetoric that has surrounded quantitative easing. In November 2010, Republican politicians, including Representative Mike Pence of Indiana, derided the policy as merely "printing money" and thus likely to result in high inflation without any benefits. The campaign of Mitt Romney, the GOP\'s presidential candidate, repeated that charge during the race for the White House two years later; another Republican candidate, Governor Rick Perry of Texas, said that if Bernanke stuck to his "almost . . . treasonous" policies, Texans would "treat him pretty ugly." Even today, editorials and op-eds in The Wall Street Journal regularly warn of the dangers of the hyperinflation yet to come as a result of Bernanke\'s monetary activism.        Without the benefit of Bernanke\'s early academic work, none of the policymakers involved in the response to the crisis would have performed as well as they did.        Toby Melville / REUTERS  Bernanke listens to questions after delivering a speech at the London School of Economics, January 2009.\r          But quantitative easing--even on the massive scale that Bernanke undertook--is nowhere near as radical a policy as its critics claim. Central banks have bought and sold securities, including private-sector securities, for centuries. It was only during a brief period--the so-called Great Moderation, which spanned the 15 years or so prior to the financial crisis--that economists and policymakers felt confident that simple adjustments to short-term interest rates were the only tool central banks needed to move markets in line with policy goals. It\'s true that economists still disagree about which kinds of assets central banks should buy, but most agree that such purchases in and of themselves hardly represent an extreme act.What is more, few bother to dispute the good such large-scale asset purchases accomplished. As Bernanke describes, in the roughly nine months after the Fed finished its first round of quantitative easing, in March 2009, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rebounded by 40 percent after having dropped in a panicked selloff; the U.S. GDP growth rate crossed into positive territory, rising to nearly four percent; and yields on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds ticked up, suggesting that "investors were expecting both more growth and higher inflation." Although they recognized that the yield increase was not attributable solely to the Fed, Bernanke and his colleagues rightly took it as "a sign of success."Compare those results to the record of the European Central Bank, which eschewed quantitative easing when an analogous panic hit eurozone bond markets and banks in 2010. Exactly as Bernanke had predicted in private--and as a host of others had publicly warned--the ECB\'s inaction led to far higher unemployment, far greater drops in output, far faster declines in prices, and far more suffering among the European public. And although many factors were involved, it is undeniable that after the ECB promised to use quantitative easing, in August 2014, economic conditions improved: unemployment has eased, the panic has subsided, and GDP growth rates have recovered.EVERYONE\'S A CRITICUnder Bernanke and Alan Greenspan, who preceded Bernanke as Fed chair, the central bank committed sins not of commission--pumping up a bubble, say, or reckless quantitative easing--but of omission. Specifically, the Fed neglected to take sufficient action to prevent the buildup of financial fragility during the first decade of this century, and it failed to act quickly enough in the run-up to the financial crisis. In the years before the crisis, the Fed correctly chose not to raise interest rates as a credit bubble grew; the real estate bubble would have continued to inflate anyway, and unemployment would have increased. But under Greenspan and Bernanke, the Fed failed to use its supervisory powers to curtail the buildup of financial imbalances, such as massively overleveraged bank portfolios, historically unprecedented rises in housing prices, and the proliferation of mortgages offered on the basis of little or no money down. Worse yet, under Greenspan, the Fed even encouraged excesses, such as the emergence of a nearly unregulated market for complex derivatives, the combining of multiple investment activities (including insurance and commercial banking) under one roof, and the widespread adoption of "off-balance-sheet activities" by government-insured institutions.  KEVIN LAMARQUE / REUTERSU.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke testify before the House Financial Services Committee in Washington, September 2008.To his credit, Bernanke points out that Ned Gramlich, a soft-spoken but forceful and independent-minded member of the Fed board from 1997 until 2005, "felt strongly about consumer protection and was skeptical of simplistic free-market dogma." Within the Fed, Gramlich spoke out about the risk of fraud and speculation in the real estate market. But his colleagues, including Greenspan and Bernanke, failed to heed Gramlich\'s warnings about insufficient regulation.The most credible criticism of Bernanke\'s record at the Fed is not that quantitative easing was a mistake but that, once major financial firms started failing in 2007, the Fed never got ahead of events. Analysts have spent years debating whether the Fed was wrong to let Lehman Brothers collapse in September 2008 but then bail out AIG, the foundering insurance giant, later that same month. The truly critical period, however, was the year prior to those emergency decisions. The Fed took little action after the bank BNP Paribas suspended three of its funds in August 2007 owing to troubles in the subprime mortgage market, or in the months that followed, as several U.S.-based lenders failed or were taken over.After Bear Stearns imploded in March 2008 and the Fed encouraged JPMorgan Chase to salvage what was left of the firm, many commentators and economists predicted that, at a minimum, other investment banks, such as Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, were likely to fail in a similar fashion and warned that panic would continue to spread. Yet Bernanke\'s memoir (like others published by people who served as high-level officials at the time) presents no convincing evidence that the Fed undertook any policies in the following weeks or months to prevent that cascade.To be fair, this was due only in part to the intellectual blinders that central bankers were wearing; in many cases, the Fed simply did not have the authority to intervene before a company\'s failure caused an overt systemic risk. Bank supervisors at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation can always resort to so-called prompt corrective action, a set of steps that allows them to go into seriously troubled commercial banks and, if necessary, shut them down. But neither the Fed nor any other regulators have the incentive, much less the authority, to take such action against other kinds of lenders, such as nonbank mortgage issuers, which were feeding the panic in the fall of 2008. The question is not whether the Fed or anyone else should be able to shut down a private business on a whim but whether the Fed or some other supervisor has the ability to intervene before that business causes other weak but salvageable firms to sell off their assets and fail, stirring more panic. The Fed did not have that authority during the crisis and faces even more constraints now, despite the fact that most other central banks--from the Bank of England to the Monetary Authority of Singapore to the ECB--have gained that kind of power since 2010 precisely because of the vulnerabilities that the crisis revealed.  Shannon Stapleton / REUTERSAn employee of Bear Stearns leaves the company\'s headquarters in New York, March 2008.The irony, of course, is that Bernanke\'s detractors now accuse him not of insufficient boldness but of overstepping the Fed\'s bounds and even abusing his power during the crisis. This charge is especially frustrating because what distinguished Bernanke as the Fed chair was his deep commitment to making the Fed more transparent and accountable--a fundamental difference between him and his two predecessors, Greenspan and Paul Volcker. Bernanke also wanted to reduce the power of the Fed chair relative to the rest of the Federal Open Market Committee, which determines U.S. monetary policy by overseeing the central banking system\'s purchases and sales of securities. While in office, he lived up to both goals by giving press conferences, making media appearances, and delivering intentionally explanatory public lectures--things that his predecessors had shunned--and by encouraging the Fed board\'s governors and the Fed\'s regional reserve bank presidents to comment in public to a degree unheard of during the Volcker and Greenspan eras.CONGRESSIONAL COWARDICEBernanke shows some restraint when writing about his opponents, particularly elected officials, but he casts the U.S. Congress as the main villain in his book--and he is perfectly justified. In its opening pages, Bernanke recounts meeting with congressional leaders in September 2008 to explain why he and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson believed it was necessary to bail out AIG in order to avoid a full-on repeat of the Great Depression. According to Bernanke, the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, a Democrat from Nevada, drew the meeting to a close by telling Bernanke and Paulson, "Don\'t mistake anything anyone has said here as constituting congres-sional approval of this action. I want to be completely clear. This is your decision and your responsibility." Reid\'s statement was striking for its sheer pusillanimity. It was not a moral objection or a warning about acting too quickly or a plea that Congress was unprepared: it was simply an abdication of all responsibility, and it was representative of the broader congressional reaction to the crisis. Congress\' inability to deliver coherent budgets also reflected a lack of courage and made the need for aggressive monetary policy all the more urgent.This unwillingness to take responsibility would not have been quite so objectionable if congressional leaders had not begun scapegoating and interfering with the Fed soon after Bernanke did take the necessary action. The Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation that Congress passed in 2010 has its virtues, but it also introduced a potentially harmful limit on the Fed\'s ability to respond to future crises. As Bernanke describes in detail, to stem the overt panic in the early stages of the financial crisis, the Fed invoked Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, which gave it the emergency ability to buy any securities and make loans to just about anyone, instead of limiting itself to commercial banks and other traditional deposit-taking institutions. That move allowed the Fed to deal with nonbanks, such as money-market funds, insurance companies, and investment firms, which had helped create the conditions for the crisis by overleveraging and making ill-advised bets on the U.S. real estate market and on the performance of other financial firms.Bernanke casts the U.S. Congress as the main villain in his book--and he is perfectly justified.\rIn the wake of the crisis, however, both left-wing and right-wing legislators strenuously attacked Section 13(3) for leading to bailouts that, as the saying went, favored "Wall Street over Main Street." Others argued that the Fed\'s emergency capacity increased the willingness of financial firms to take excessive risks. And so Dodd-Frank effectively eliminated Section 13(3), leaving the Fed with fewer options for the next time a panic draws in firms that are not traditional banks but that are nonetheless important to the financial system.THE FIRE NEXT TIMEToday\'s overly constrained Fed and insufficient regulatory measures pose very real risks, and Bernanke should have emphasized that point more in his memoir. Postcrisis reforms have strengthened the resilience of traditional banks one by one, notably by increasing banks\' capital requirements and requiring more liquidity. This should put more of the banks\' own money at stake and thus induce them to be more prudent. But microregulations alone will not prevent many financial catastrophes. Authorities can try to prevent house fires by regulating building materials, threatening to fine builders who don\'t follow codes, and persuading homeowners to be extra vigilant by prohibiting insurance payments in cases in which houses burn down owing to carelessness. But cities still need well-equipped fire departments to fight blazes that erupt despite their best efforts at prevention. Limiting Section 13(3) was akin to taking away the fire department\'s trucks and hoses. Without the right tools, the Fed will be able to fight only those financial fires that have already spread.  JONATHAN ERNST / REUTERSBernanke addresses the National Economists Club annual dinner at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington, November 2013.Of course, congressional distrust of central bankers is not just a recurrent theme in Bernanke\'s memoir; it is a leitmotif in U.S. history. Still, such disdain seems particularly tragic and harmful to the public interest when directed at the most open Federal Reserve ever, which succeeded precisely where the central bank failed at the outbreak of the Great Depression. Congress has the right to be wary of the Fed, but it is wrong to base its doubts on the Fed\'s recent performance. And as is often the case with attempts to limit the power of the U.S. federal government, congressional restraints on the Fed have diminished the American people\'s economic security.Many in the global central-banking community believe that the Fed is constrained only in theory, and that in practice, when the next crisis hits, the Fed will again improvise: at the crucial moment, its leaders will manage to act, just as Bernanke and his colleagues did. I find that faith ill founded. As Bernanke notes, during his tenure, Congress micromanaged so intently that it even tried to dictate how many people he was allowed to have in the room when making critical decisions. To this day, some seats on the Fed board remain unfilled because Republicans in Congress have refused to confirm qualified nominees or even bring them up for a vote. If Congress treated the U.S. military with that level of pettiness, it would be seen, rightly, as self-defeating. It is a sad commentary on the state of U.S. politics that a figure as open, articulate, and deft as Bernanke could not protect the Fed\'s ability to act, despite having shown courage and wisdom in action. blank'

S'The nuclear deal that the United States and five other great powers signed with Iran in July 2015 is the final product of a decadelong effort at arms control. That effort included sanctions in an attempt to impede Iran\'s quest for a nuclear weapons capability. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, ranks as one of the most deficient arms control agreements in history. But U.S. President Barack Obama has pledged to spend the remainder of his tenure fending off congressional pressures to adjust its terms.An even larger issue, however, is Washington\'s lack of a comprehensive Iran policy. For decades, the United States has refused to deal with the crucial subject that makes the nuclear issue so important, which is the nature of the Iranian regime. Any Iran policy worthy of the name must start from the fact that the Islamic Republic is not a conventional state making pragmatic estimates of its national interests but a revolutionary regime.U.S. policymakers since the days of President Ronald Reagan have failed to understand that there can be no rapprochement between the two governments, because, as Iran\'s leaders understand, that would undo the very existence of the Iranian regime. They have overlooked the fact that Iran is an exceptionally dangerous state--to its neighbors, to close U.S. allies such as Israel, and to the broader stability of the Middle East.Given the serious challenge Iran poses to U.S. interests, Washington should seek to roll back the country\'s growing influence in the Middle East while systematically eroding the foundations of its power. In the long term, the Islamic Republic will join the Soviet Union and other ideological relics of the twentieth century in eventual collapse. Until then, however, there can be no real peace between Washington and Tehran.A RAW DEALNo sensible Iran policy can coexist with the JCPOA as it stands today. The agreement recognizes Iran\'s right to enrich uranium and eventually industrialize that capacity. It concedes that Iran can construct an elaborate nuclear infrastructure for research and development. It establishes a verification system that gives Iran far too much advance notice of inspections and does not meaningfully limit the development of ballistic missiles, a pillar of any nuclear weapons program. It does not provide adequate access to the facilities and scientists involved in Iran\'s past work on nuclear weapons, thus denying inspectors the knowledge they need to assess the scope of Iran\'s current program. And after 15 years, once the agreement expires, Iran will be free to build as many nuclear installations as it wants, accumulate as much enriched uranium as it wishes, and enrich that uranium to whatever level it deems necessary. In essence, the JCPOA establishes Iran as a threshold nuclear power today and paves the way for an eventual Iranian bomb.The agreement will also encourage Iran\'s regional rivals to go nuclear. Iran\'s Sunni competitors for power, particularly Saudi Arabia, are unlikely to stand idly by as Iran looks forward to a near future in which it faces no nuclear restraints. The United Arab Emirates, which had renounced uranium enrichment as part of its civilian nuclear agreement with the United States, is now reconsidering its pledge. Ironically, the Obama administration will likely provoke the very nuclear arms race it hoped to avoid.Supporters of the deal point to the economic exigencies that compelled Tehran to agree to it, but Tehran was also motivated by the scientific imperatives of building nuclear weapons. For much of its existence, Iran\'s nuclear program was subject to sabotage and sanctions and relied on primitive centrifuges. As Hamid Baeidinejad, one of Iran\'s lead negotiators, has admitted, the Iranian scientific establishment appreciated that a reliable industrial-size nuclear program required advanced centrifuges, ones that operated as much as 20 times as fast as the primitive ones. And Iranian officials understood the need to shield their program from sabotage and possible military retribution. The problem was that it would take approximately eight to ten years to introduce the new generation of centrifuges. So the challenge for Iran\'s diplomats was to legitimize the nuclear program while negotiating a research-and-development schedule that fulfilled the scientists\' requirements.The final agreement met these needs. The JCPOA allows Iran to develop advanced centrifuges and begin installing them in the eighth year of the agreement. Thus, not only did Iran get the sanctions removed and its nuclear program legitimized; it also obtained the timeline it needed for the mass production of advanced centrifuges. Indeed, in highlighting the achievements of his negotiators, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani emphasized "the development of new centrifuges--from concept to mass production." So fast and efficient are the new generation of centrifuges that Iran could easily build a small facility producing weapons-grade uranium that would evade detection. And once Iran is in possession of weapons-grade uranium, it will also have a fleet of reliable ballistic missiles at hand.REVISE AND RESUBMIT    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display("dfp-ad-x90_2");    });  Given the many disturbing aspects of the JCPOA, the next U.S. president must revise it. Even Secretary of State John Kerry has acknowledged that a future administration might want to find "some way to strengthen it." Indeed, there are a number of ways to do so.Most important, the United States should undo the sunset clause, which lifts some of the most essential restrictions on Iran\'s program within as little as eight years. Instead of having an arbitrary timeline determine the longevity of the accord, U.S. officials should insist that when the deal expires, the United States, the five other great powers that signed the deal, and Iran hold a majority vote on whether to extend the agreement\'s restrictions for an additional five years--and that such a vote be held every five years thereafter. The precedent for such a move is the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty: after that treaty expired, the vast majority of the member states voted to extend it in perpetuity.The United States should also call on Iran to ship all its enriched uranium out of the country for good. After all, the JCPOA itself stipulates that Iran\'s spent fuel from its plutonium production will be sent out permanently; a similar process should be put in place for its enriched uranium. And given that the new generation of centrifuges would dramatically expand Iran\'s enrichment capacity and shorten its nuclear-breakout time, the United States should insist that Iran\'s centrifuge stock be limited to the rudimentary centrifuges. As for Iran\'s ballistic missiles, they have no legitimate function other than delivering a nuclear payload, and so the international community should continue to demand that Iran permanently forgo the development of such missiles.No sensible Iran policy can coexist with the nuclear deal as it stands today.The United States should also press for more intrusive inspections. The current plan gives Iran 24 days to admit inspectors to certain sites--a far cry from the "anytime, anywhere" inspections that the White House had promised. A revised deal should draw on the experience of South Africa, which dismantled its nuclear weapons around 1990. It provided the International Atomic Energy Agency a full accounting of its previous nuclear history and allowed inspectors to visit military installations with as little as a day\'s notice. Since it was determined to disarm, South Africa had no qualms about such requirements. If Iran is committed to proving its goodwill, it should accept a similar verification system.According to the Obama administration, any attempt to revisit the JCPOA\'s procedures would spark an international outcry, isolating the United States from its allies. Such overwrought claims ignore the fact that the JCPOA is not a legally binding treaty but a voluntary political agreement. Moreover, the JCPOA commands the support of neither the American public nor its elected representatives in Congress. A new president can and should reconsider it.Admittedly, U.S. allies might not be so eager to revise the JCPOA. The product of a painstaking multilateral effort, the agreement has the unanimous support of the UN Security Council. Still, most of Washington\'s Middle Eastern allies would welcome changes. Israel opposes the deal, and Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia have made it clear that their support for the JCPOA is tepid at best and largely an effort to please the Obama administration.France, Germany, and the United Kingdom will prove harder to convince. The next president should make it clear to these allies that he or she is prepared to negotiate with Iran but intends to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear capability. In private, U.S. diplomats should convey the message that the way that European countries react to amendments to the JCPOA will affect their relations with the United States. A determined president could mobilize the international community behind a set of demands that would measurably strengthen the agreement and broaden its bipartisan appeal at home.Supporters of the JCPOA suggest that Iran will never agree to such revisions. But nations do end up negotiating agreements that once seemed impossible. During arms control negotiations with the Soviets in the early 1980s, the commentariat blasted Reagan as naive for insisting that the Soviet Union remove all its intermediate-range missiles from Europe. And yet in 1987, Moscow did exactly that. Facing grave internal problems, the Soviets had little choice but to negotiate; the same should hold true for Iran today, especially with greater pressure from and patience on the part of the United States.ISOLATE AND COERCEIn addition to revising the nuclear agreement, the United States should punish Iran for its regional aggression, sponsorship of terrorism, or human rights abuses. To do so, it should segregate Iran from the global economy by restoring as much of the sanctions architecture as possible. (As Kerry has conceded, even with the deal in place, any Iranian entity that participates in terrorism or human rights abuses could still face sanctions.) And it should launch a campaign of political warfare to intensify the Iranian public\'s disenchantment with the regime and deepen dissension within the ruling circle.The Obama administration has shown a curious reluctance to criticize the Islamic Republic for its domestic abuses. The White House appears to have wanted a nuclear deal so desperately that it declined to pass judgment on Iran\'s rulers, even as the Islamist regime jailed dissidents, rigged elections, censored the media, and set records for executions of prisoners. The United States has a moral obligation to speak out against such transgressions. And no strategy of pressure can succeed without a concerted attempt to stress Iran at home.Future historians will look back at 2009 as the year modern Iran changed decisively. That June, a placid presidential race featuring lackluster candidates suddenly turned into an intense contest for political power as Iranians took to the streets to protest the fraudulent results. The episode delegitimized theocratic rule and severed the bonds between the state and society. Since then, the political space in Iran has narrowed, as the hard-liners have eviscerated the left wing of the body politic. The country\'s most popular politicians have been either excluded from the corridors of power or thrown in prison.  Ruben Sprich / ReutersIran\'s President Hassan Rouhani smiles during a session at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, January 2014.The election of Rouhani in 2013 did not, as some in the West naively believed, signal the advent of a newly reformist regime. Rouhani has demonstrated no interest in pursuing democratic or human rights reforms; his charge was merely to stabilize the nuclear file. Today, the guardians of the revolution preside over a state that has been systematically hollowed out and increasingly relies on fear to perpetuate its rule.To delegitimize the Islamic Republic, U.S. officials must begin by sharply challenging the regime\'s values and viability. They should castigate Iran as a remnant of twentieth-century totalitarianism that will inevitably go extinct. No one has a greater power to mobilize dissent abroad than a U.S. president. Reagan\'s denunciations of the Soviet Union did much to galvanize the forces of change behind the Iron Curtain. It is unfortunate that Obama, a gifted speaker, has declined to embrace the Iranian people\'s struggle for freedom. The next president should.Meanwhile, the U.S. government should take to television, radio, and social media with the message that clerical misrule has resulted only in economic deprivation and political disenfranchisement. It should showcase Iran\'s costly imperial ventures and the diversion of its scarce resources to terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and despots such as Bashar al-Assad in Syria. It should contrast life in Iran as it is with what it could be under more responsible rulers. At the same time, the United States should encourage and publicize defections from inside the regime. These could sow confusion and distrust within an already paranoid government.The United States made a tragic mistake in staying silent during Iran\'s 2009 protests.To add to the pressure, the United States should target some of its sanctions on the part of the regime most responsible for repression, terrorism, and regional aggression: the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. That group boasts substantial business holdings in a range of areas, including the automotive sector, telecommunications, energy, construction, engineering, shipping, and air transportation. Washington should subject these interests to secondary sanctions in addition to primary ones, meaning that any firms dealing with the entities would lose their access to the U.S. market. To facilitate such a step, the State Department should designate Iran\'s Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist organization, which would mean that international firms that established commercial ties with the group would jeopardize their access to the U.S. market. And the U.S. government should designate a greater number of officials within the group as human rights abusers.Washington should also keep in place sanctions against Iran\'s financial institutions. These restrictions have succeeded in preventing Iran from conducting normal transactions through the global financial system. And with good reason: as the U.S. Treasury has repeatedly found, the country\'s leading banks have been implicated in a range of crimes, including nuclear proliferation, terrorism, and money laundering.The United States made a tragic mistake in staying silent during Iran\'s 2009 protests, but the Islamic Republic remains vulnerable to popular revolt. Indeed, since its inception, the theocracy has battled protest movements demanding accountability and freedom. In the early years of the revolution, the mullahs had to repress a range of secular forces that wanted to steer the nation in a more liberal direction. In the 1990s, reformers insisted on an Islamic government that nonetheless accommodated democratic norms. And in 2009, the Green Movement rocked the foundations of the system. The only certainty about Iran\'s future is that another protest movement will eventually emerge. And at that time, the United States must be ready to stand with it.  Demotix / ReutersProtesters march during a demonstration against the results of the Iranian presidential election in central Tehran, June 2009.REGIONAL ROLLBACKFor Iran\'s recalcitrant mullahs to yield to international norms, all the walls around them have to close in. So as it stresses Iran\'s economy and divides its society, the United States should also push back against its influence around the Middle East. By contesting Tehran\'s gains, Washington can impose additional costs on the regime and contribute to regional stability.That means helping the region reconstitute its failed states and end its many civil wars, since Iran thrives on chaos. At the moment, Iran seems to have reached the zenith of its power. Its clients dominate three Arab capitals--Damascus, Baghdad, and Sanaa--and are highly influential in a fourth, Beirut. Hundreds, if not thousands, of its agents and soldiers have entered Syria to fight for the Assad regime. In Hezbollah, it has an obedient force of guerrillas, light infantry, and terrorists.Yet these activities carry the risk of overextension. Already, Iran has suffered battlefield casualties among the officer corps of its elite Quds Force, part of the Revolutionary Guard, and as it sends more fighters to Syria, it may be making itself a bigger target. In the meantime, Iran has to bear the costs of sustaining the myriad of militias and terrorist organizations that it subsidizes across the region. Imperialism may be tempting, but it is also financially draining.As the United States confronts Iran, it will need regional actors to bear their own measure of responsibility. None of these players wishes to succumb to Iran\'s imperial pretensions, but as the United States has retreated, they have hedged their bets between the two adversaries. Those days must end. Iraqi politicians, Gulf princes, Syrian rebels--all must play a role in pushing back against Iran. U.S. officials should make it clear that in exchange for American guardianship, Arab allies will have to curtail their commercial links to and lessen their diplomatic representation in Tehran. As Iran\'s leaders look over the horizon, they should see an Arab world coalescing against them under the auspices of the United States.The creation of a new anti-Iran coalition will require something that the Obama administration has lacked: a strategy that tightens the constraints on Tehran and consolidates Washington\'s relationships with its traditional allies. That won\'t be easy. American passivity has allowed the region to devolve into a vortex of conflicting groups and interests, and the American public understandably worries about any policy that requires large numbers of American boots on the ground. The recent addition of Russian military power into the equation only heightens the degree of difficulty.Of course, many of these problems could have been avoided had the United States provided effective aid to the reasonable elements of the Syrian opposition back in 2011. Doing the same today would be difficult, if not impossible, as the Syrian population has become more radicalized and extremist groups have seized more territory. Nonetheless, the United States can still train and equip surrogates who are capable of inflicting greater losses on the regime--chief among them the Kurds, Arab tribal fighters, and the Druze. But these groups will achieve meaningful battlefield gains only if the United States allows them to attack the Assad regime. Previous training programs failed in part because they required the rebels to limit their attacks to the Islamic State, or ISIS, and so they faced difficulties with recruiting. Greater support and leeway for the opposition would no doubt ease these problems, as would the presence of more U.S. Special Forces personnel, including forward air controllers, inside Syrian borders.Tipping the balance of forces against the Assad regime will also require convincing Turkey to reorder its priorities in Syria. To date, the Turks have focused first on fighting the Kurds and second on fighting Assad, with the battle against ISIS a distant third. Bringing Ankara into closer alignment with U.S. policy will require a real exchange of views, rather than the dialogue of the deaf that has gone on since 2011. U.S. diplomats will have to demonstrate that they share Turkey\'s desire to rid Syria of the Assad regime. The Turks, in turn, will have to abandon their fixation on waging war on the Kurds and agree to make the fight against Assad and ISIS their top priorities. Turkey needs to be convinced that the best way to improve relations with the Kurds is for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to return to his earlier policy of improving their plight within Turkey.Washington also needs to back a safe zone for refugees, which would almost certainly require a no-fly zone. (Turkey has long wanted the United States to establish a safe zone, but its request has been met with indifference and disdain.) A safe zone that protected the Syrian populace from Assad\'s barrel bombs and chlorine gas attacks would help stanch the flow of refugees and manage the tragic humanitarian consequences of the Syrian civil war. Properly administered, it would also provide a visible alternative to the cruelties of life under ISIS rule and help create the space in which a moderate Sunni Arab opposition to Assad could grow.Critics of a U.S.-enforced no-fly zone object that given the presence of Russian aircraft, the risks of an accidental conflict are too high. For that reason, the Obama administration seems to have taken a no-fly zone off the table. But Russian President Vladimir Putin no doubt shares U.S. concerns about an unintended confrontation and would have every reason to refrain from challenging a no-fly zone. And the ongoing discussions between Moscow and Washington to "deconflict" their air campaigns over Syria ought to limit the chances of a clash.When it comes to the Syrian civil war, the Obama administration appears to have taken the position that there is no military solution and that a diplomatic solution requires a political settlement that only Iran and Russia can broker. Unfortunately, it is not at all clear that those two countries are open to such a settlement, but in the event that they are, they will do everything they can beforehand to advantage their client Assad. In that case, anti-Assad forces will still have to make gains on the ground in order to create the conditions for an acceptable settlement. Otherwise, the result will be capitulation to an Iranian-Russian condominium.BANDING TOGETHERWashington should also seek to reduce Iran\'s influence in Baghdad--a difficult task, but one made easier by the fact that most Iraqi Arabs, Shiites included, have no interest in serving Iran. The main goal should be to destroy ISIS, thereby diminishing the Iraqi government\'s reliance on Iranian support. If the United States built on its relationships with the Iraqi Kurds, moderate Iraqi Shiites, and Iraqi Sunnis, Iran would at least have a harder time using Iraq as a base for its larger schemes.At a practical level, Washington should push Baghdad to govern more inclusively, so that the central government is seen as benefiting Sunnis and Kurds, and not just Shiites. It should make an outreach to the Sunni tribes on a scale equivalent to what took place during the 2007 surge of U.S. troops. And it should ramp up its military assistance to the Kurds and Sunni tribal forces, intensify the air campaign against ISIS in both Iraq and Syria, and embed U.S. personnel in the Iraqi military at lower levels than it currently does. A heightened U.S. presence in Iraq need not entail a massive combat force there, but it would mean a larger troop presence and thus a greater risk of casualties. Again, the price for greater U.S. involvement should be a commitment on the part of local actors to press back against Tehran and its enablers.Iran\'s influence in the Middle East extends beyond Syria and Iraq. In Yemen, it stems from the success of the Houthi rebels, a Shiite group that now controls large swaths of the country. The Gulf states have taken the lead in pushing back the Houthis. If those states need help with, say, maintaining a blockade to prevent Iranian ships from resupplying their clients, then the United States should offer it. Only Washington can provide the capabilities for patrolling the global commons, including intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance.  Mohamed al-Sayaghi / ReutersA Houthi follower carries a mock missile as he shouts slogans during a demonstration against the United Nations in Sanaa, Yemen, July 2015.As Washington attempts to weaken Iran\'s hand in the region, it will need to earn back the trust of Israel and the Gulf states. It cannot simply buy these countries off with more arms sales, although those will be necessary. Rather, U.S. officials will have to consult with them regularly and in depth about the nature of the Iranian problem. The goal should be to generate an overall strategy that builds on the tacit understanding that Israel and the Gulf states are in the same strategic predicament regarding Iran. Once that is done, Iran\'s regional opponents will have an easier time coordinating policy, as well as covert activity, and the United States will have an easier time publicly defending measures aimed at countering Iranian influence.Getting the Gulf states to agree to take common action has always been hard, but after years of neglect from the Obama administration, they are now more likely to be receptive to a new U.S. strategy against Iran. The United States should help the Gulf states not only as they battle Iranian proxies in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen but also as they deal with a range of other challenges. These include protecting themselves against Iran\'s efforts to undermine their internal security, defending their economic infrastructure (such as oil and gas platforms, water-desalinization plants, and tourist sites), and preventing Iran from interdicting their energy exports along key transit routes.To confront Iran, the Gulf states will need capabilities commensurate with the challenge. In particular, the United States should consider supplying them with systems that defend against guided rockets and mortars, such as the Centurion C-RAM. The United States could also broker cooperation with Israel aimed at giving the Gulf states their own version of the Iron Dome defense system, which they could use to defend their vital economic and tourist infrastructure against Iranian missiles. And in the long run, the Gulf states have the financial resources, even at current oil prices, to invest in the next generation of missile defense technologies, such as directed-energy weapons, which would diminish Iran\'s ability to attack them.The countries in the region with formidable special-forces capabilities, such as Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, should use that advantage to help some of the more vulnerable countries, such as Bahrain, deal with their internal security problems--arrangements that Washington could help broker. Iran\'s adversaries could even develop a subset of special forces capable of operating inside Iran to exploit the grievances of various ethnic minorities. The goal would be to make Iran think twice about its campaign of regional subversion by demonstrating that two can play that game.Finally, the Gulf states need to further reduce Iran\'s ability to choke off oil exports by blocking the Strait of Hormuz. Although they have already built pipelines to bypass the strait, they should also take steps to increase those pipelines\' capacity. The Gulf states should invest in capabilities such as advanced air-to-air missiles to take down Iran\'s aircraft and land-attack cruise missiles to destroy its antiship cruise missiles. And they should augment that effort with the undersea capabilities needed for a campaign against Iran\'s surface naval assets, including its many small boats.This agenda would represent a tall order for U.S. diplomats and military officials, yet even merely consulting allies about efforts to roll back Iranian influence would immediately get Tehran\'s attention. As big an effort as it might represent, a plan on this scale will be necessary to awaken Iranian leaders to the costs they will suffer if they continue to destabilize the Middle East. If properly executed, such a strategy might even bring about a change of course--or a fatal increase in the contradictions that beset an already overstretched regime.NO NEED TO SETTLE  A regime as dangerous to U.S. interests as Tehran requires a comprehensive strategy to counter it. That means exploiting all of Iran\'s vulnerabilities: increasing the costs of its foreign adventures, weakening its economy, and backing its domestic discontents. Pursuing that strategy will take time, but eventually, it will put the United States in a position to impose terms on Iran, including in the nuclear realm. Washington should strive for a stringent arms control agreement, not one that presages an Iranian bomb. It should compel Iran to cease much of its regional subversion, not create power vacuums that encourage it. And it should move human rights up the agenda, not look the other way as Iran\'s leaders oppress their people.Some in Washington believe that the Iran problem is of secondary importance to the United States compared with violent jihadist groups such as ISIS. Not so. For all their achievements in the chaotic lands of Syria and western Iraq, those radical movements do not yet possess the resources and capabilities of a large, sophisticated state. Iran does. Remember, the Iranian regime was the original Islamic revolutionary state. Its successes inspired a wave of radicals across the Middle East.At its most basic level, the confrontation between the United States and Iran is a conflict between the world\'s sole superpower and a second-rate autocracy. Washington does not need to settle for a disastrously flawed arms control agreement and hope that theocrats with no interest in relaxing their grip will somehow become moderates. A determined policy of pressure would speed the day when the Iranian people replace a regime that has made their lives miserable. And in the interim, it would reduce the threat that a triumphant, nuclear-armed regime would pose to the Middle East and the world beyond. '

S'After Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine in March 2014, the Obama administration responded with what has become the go-to foreign policy tool these days: targeted sanctions. The United States placed asset freezes and travel bans on more than one hundred people, mostly cronies of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the EU targeted almost a hundred more. The amounts involved have been massive: Bank Rossiya, the Kremlin\'s preferred bank, had $572 million frozen in the months after the sanctions were rolled out. Then, in July 2014, when Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine allegedly by Russian-backed forces, Washington responded with more severe sanctions aimed at key sectors of the Russian economy, including arms manufacturers, banks, and state firms. In an effort to hit the Kremlin where it hurts, the measures inhibit financing and technology transfers to Russian oil and gas companies, which supply over half of state revenues.Considering the dire state of Russia\'s economy, these sanctions might appear to be working. The value of the ruble has fallen by 76 percent against the dollar since the restrictions were imposed, and inflation for consumer goods hit 16 percent in 2015. That same year, the International Monetary Fund estimated, Russia\'s GDP was to shrink by more than three percent.In fact, however, Western policymakers got lucky: the sanctions coincided with the collapse of global oil prices, worsening, but not causing, Russia\'s economic decline. The ruble\'s exchange rate has tracked global oil prices more closely than any new sanctions, and many of the actions taken by the Russian government, including the slashing of the state budget, are similar to those it took when oil prices fell during the 2008 financial crisis. The sanctions have inhibited access to Western financing, forcing Russian banks to turn to the government for help. This has run down the Kremlin\'s foreign reserves and led the government to engage in various unorthodox financial maneuvers, such as allowing the state-owned oil company Rosneft to recapitalize itself from state coffers. Yet the Russian government has been able to weather the crisis by providing emergency capital to wobbling banks, allowing the ruble to float freely, and making targeted cuts to the state budget while providing fiscal stimulus through increased spending on pensions. Even with continued low oil prices, the International Monetary Fund expects that growth will return to the Russian economy in 2016, albeit at a sluggish 1.5 percent.  Sergei Karpukhin / REUTERSPeople walk under boards displaying currency exchange rates in Moscow, September 2014.Nor are the sanctions inflicting much pain on Russia\'s elites. Although Prada and Tiffany are doing less business in Moscow, the luxury housing market is anemic, and travel bans rule out weekend jaunts to Manhattan, these restrictions are hardly unbearable. One target, the close Putin adviser Vladislav Surkov, has dismissed them as harmless. "The only things that interest me in the U.S. are Tupac Shakur, Allen Ginsberg, and Jackson Pollock," he said. "I don\'t need a visa to access their work."And when the sanctions are judged by the most relevant metric--whether they are producing a policy change--they have been an outright failure. Since the United States imposed the sanctions, Russia has not backed down in Ukraine, and there is no reason to believe that they will force it to do so anytime soon. In the meantime, however, the sanctions are harming U.S. economic and geopolitical interests. If Western leaders want to resolve the Ukraine crisis and meaningfully constrain Russia\'s bad behavior, they should abandon their failed sanctions-centric policy and focus on other measures instead, such as efforts to aid Ukraine economically, obstruct Russia\'s military modernization, and increase European energy independence.UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCESWhatever punishment the sanctions have inflicted on Russia, it has not translated into coercion. The Obama administration appears to have expected that it would have by now: in February 2015, for example, Christine Wormuth, the U.S. undersecretary of defense for policy, admitted that the sanctions had "not changed so far what Russia has been doing on the ground, and that is the great concern."Indeed, after the initial round of sanctions, the Kremlin\'s aggression only grew: Russia formally absorbed Crimea and upped its financial and military support for pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine (including those who most likely shot down the Malaysia Airlines flight). It is possible that the sanctions may have deterred Russia from even greater aggression in Ukraine, but it is equally possible that all Russia ever wanted to do there was create a slow-burning insurgency. And at any rate, the sanctions have failed to force Russia to withdraw from Crimea and stop meddling in eastern Ukraine. This should not be surprising: as the most comprehensive study of sanctions found, they fail to achieve their goals in 66 percent of cases, and they fail 79 percent of the time when designed to discourage military misadventurism.The Kremlin\'s aggression has persisted in large part because the West\'s targeted sanctions have succumbed to the same problem that plagues traditional comprehensive sanctions: the targeted regime shelters its cronies, while the rest of the population suffers. It wasn\'t supposed to be this way. Modern sanctions are designed to avoid replicating the flaws of the comprehensive embargo placed on Iraq during the 1990s, which served only to enrich Saddam Hussein\'s regime and impoverish the Iraqi people. With Russia, the U.S. government made sure not to bar overall trade and instead imposed asset freezes and financing restrictions on individual politicians and companies. In theory, members of Putin\'s inner circle would use their influence to convince the president to reconsider his bellicose Ukraine policy.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display("dfp-ad-x90_2");    });  Whatever punishment the sanctions have inflicted on Russia, it has not translated into coercion.In practice, however, the sanctions have had the unintended consequence of inflicting widespread punishment on the Russian economy and population. By restricting access to international financing during a recession, the sanctions have compounded the fall in oil prices, requiring Moscow to slash spending on health care, infrastructure, and government salaries, which has created economic hardship for ordinary Russians. The crash of the ruble, meanwhile, has not only destroyed savings but also increased the monthly payments of those who hold mortgages denominated in foreign currencies. The government, in turn, has pressured struggling Russian banks to convert such debt into rubles and absorb the losses, which has rescued homeowners from default but run down banks\' capital reserves.Adding to the pain was the Russian government\'s decision to issue its own set of sanctions, which have barred the import of Western foodstuffs. Although the move has hurt eastern European farmers and exporters, it has also created shortages and increased food prices inside Russia. Then there was the unforeseen credit crunch among ordinary consumers. Fearful of a legal backlash, many U.S. and European banks cut off not only billionaire bank owners but also many of their customers. In March 2014, for example, Visa and MasterCard suspended all transactions from four Russian banks in response to sanctions placed on its owners, effectively canceling the credit cards of ordinary Russian consumers. The U.S. government had to intervene to convince the companies to start processing payments again.At the same time that the sanctions have punished the population at large, the Kremlin has sheltered key supporters from their impact. For example, from March to December 2014, companies linked to the Putin cronies Arkady Rotenberg and Gennady Timchenko received 12 percent more in government contracts than they had during the entire previous year. The government also stripped Russia\'s largest private bank, Alfa-Bank, of a lucrative contract to service the country\'s electricity market, awarding it instead to Bank Rossiya.The Kremlin has also managed to circumvent the sanctions, partly by turning to China. In May 2014, Putin visited the country to seal a 30-year, $400 billion gas deal with it, demonstrating that Russia has alternatives to European gas markets. That October, Moscow and Beijing also agreed to a 150 billion yuan currency swap, allowing companies such as Gazprom to trade commodities in rubles and yuan--and thus steer clear of U.S. financial regulations. Even in Europe, Russia has been able to find loopholes to avoid the sanctions: in order to obtain access to Arctic drilling equipment and expertise, Rosneft acquired 30 percent of the North Atlantic drilling projects belonging to the Norwegian company Statoil.  Mikhail Klimentyev / Sputnik / Kremlin / ReutersRussian President Vladimir Putin shakes hands with U.S. President Barack Obama during the Paris Climate Change Conference at Le Bourget, France, November 2015.It is tempting to believe that the sanctions will eventually work--say, after a few more years--but that is wishful thinking. U.S. and European negotiations with Russia have focused on the near future, including the implementation of the Minsk II agreement, an armistice with a deadline of December 2015, and with good reason: a drawn-out insurgency is the worst-case scenario for Ukraine and its Western backers. The sanctions were intended to compel Russia to cooperate with this international diplomatic process and withdraw from Crimea; if it doesn\'t do so before the Minsk deadline, it is unlikely to in the future. Indeed, as academic studies suggest, the longer sanctions are in place, the less likely they are to produce a policy change. And in the case of Russia, if the price of oil rises again in the next few years, as is likely, their impact will diminish further.THE COSTS OF CONTAINMENTIt is true that the sanctions have allowed the Obama administration to claim that it is doing something about Russian aggression. From the White House\'s perspective, that might be an acceptable rationale for the policy, so long as there were no downsides. In fact, however, the sanctions carry major economic and political costs for the United States and its European allies.The brunt is being borne by Europe, where the European Commission has estimated that the sanctions cut growth by 0.3 percent of GDP in 2015. According to the Austrian Institute of Economic Research, continuing the sanctions on Russia could cost over 90 billion euros in export revenue and more than two million jobs over the next few years. The sanctions are proving especially painful for countries with strong trade ties to Russia. Germany, Russia\'s largest European partner, stands to lose almost 400,000 jobs. Meanwhile, a number of European banks, including Societe Generale in France and Raiffeisen Zentralbank in Austria, have made large loans to Russian companies, raising the worrying possibility that the banks may become unstable, or even require bailouts if the borrowers default.In the United States, banks are taking much of the impact. U.S. financial institutions have been required by law to freeze and manage tens of millions of dollars in assets of sanctioned individuals. As a result, the banks have had to hire additional legal and technical staff to not only monitor their own accounts but also review any financing arrangements with Russian entities. Failure to comply with the sanctions can be extremely costly: just one error, such as processing a single payment from an interdicted individual, can carry a penalty of up to $250,000, and the penalties can quickly multiply. In 2010, the Dutch bank ABN AMRO was fined $500 million for violating U.S. sanctions against Cuba, Iran, Libya, and Sudan.U.S. energy companies, for their part, have had to abandon various joint ventures in Russia, losing access to billions of dollars of investments. Thanks to prohibitions on the provision of technology and services to Russian companies, Western firms have been kept out of unconventional drilling projects in the Arctic and elsewhere. ExxonMobil, for example, has been forced to withdraw from all ten of its joint ventures with Rosneft, including a $3.2 billion project in the Kara Sea. Because that project was in its early stages, the cancellation will not cost ExxonMobil in immediate profits. But it will cut access to upstream development projects inside Russia, putting the company\'s future profits and stock valuation at risk and raising the possibility that the money already invested will be permanently lost.  Maxim Shemetov / REUTERS  Pro-Russian rebels adjust the radio as they prepare to listen to Russian President Vladimir Putin\'s annual end-of-year news conference broadcast in Donetsk, December 2014.          A similar dynamic may harm European energy security, too. Because the sanctions prohibit Western companies from financing Russia\'s largest energy firms, the Russian companies have cut back on upstream exploration and development. In this, the sanctions may achieve their intended goal of reducing state revenue, but that will come as a result of shortfalls in supply. The energy consultancy IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates has predicted that if the sanctions persist, Russian oil production could decrease from 10.5 million barrels per day now to 7.6 million barrels per day by 2025--bad news for European states, which receive one-third of their oil from Russia. They are even more dependent on Russian gas, which, since it relies more on fixed pipelines, is harder to replace.But it is in the realm of Russian politics that the sanctions have been most counterproductive. The sanctions have had a "rally round the flag" effect as the Russian people blame their ills on the West. According to the Levada Center, a Russian research organization, Putin\'s approval rating increased from 63 percent during the invasion of Crimea to 88 percent by October 2015. In another poll, more than two-thirds of respondents said they thought the primary goal of the sanctions was to weaken and humiliate Russia. State propaganda is of course playing a role, but the sanctions have made it easier for Putin to sell his anti-Western narrative. They allow him to deflect blame away from his own economic mismanagement and toward what he has called "external factors."The sanctions are also having the perverse effect of enabling Putin to further consolidate his power, because he has rewarded his closest cronies at the expense of other elites. According to data from Forbes\' list of billionaires, Russia\'s 15 richest citizens lost an average of 20 percent of their wealth in 2014, before regaining 12 percent in the next six months as the market stabilized. These fluctuations track the broader Russian economy, but after one breaks down the data, some telling disparities emerge. On average, those billionaires who held stakes in sanctioned companies lost less than three percent of their wealth between January 2014 and June 2015, whereas those who did not lost nine percent. It requires no great leap of logic to see that the Kremlin has shielded those with connections to the ruling circle from the pain of the sanctions, thereby shifting the burden to those without such ties.The sanctions have also encouraged Russia to create its own financial institutions, which, in the long run, will chip away at the United States\' economic influence. After U.S. senators and some European governments suggested that the United States might cut off Russia\'s access to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) payment system, the Russian Central Bank announced that it was going to start negotiations with the other BRICS states--Brazil, India, China, and South Africa--to create an alternative. To lessen its dependence on Visa and MasterCard, Russia has made moves toward setting up its own credit-card clearing-house. And it has moved ahead with the proposed BRICS development bank, which is designed to replicate the functions of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.The sanctions allow Putin to deflect blame away from his own economic mismanagement.Although none of these initiatives has come to fruition yet, they raise the worrying possibility that the United States will someday have a harder time employing economic statecraft. Even though sanctions have failed with Russia, they can work against smaller states, which, since they lack the cash reserves and ability to ramp up domestic production, cannot so easily compensate for the cutoff of foreign trade and investment. But in a world where more institutions fall outside the reach of the United States and its allies, those targets can more easily circumvent U.S. sanctions. The recent measures directed at Iran for its nuclear program, for example, would have been less likely to drive the regime toward the bargaining table had it been able to turn to alternative organizations for transaction and financing support. Likewise, Russia\'s shift away from trading in the dollar could make future U.S. sanctions less effective, since transactions structured as currency swaps do not require access to the U.S. financial system.ACCEPTING FAILUREIf the United States continues to insist that the sanctions against Russia need more time to work, then the costs will continue to add up, while the likelihood of changing the Kremlin\'s behavior will get even slimmer. The West does indeed need to respond to Moscow\'s adventurism, but it should do so largely through other means.To start, the Obama administration should make one final attempt to obtain some benefit from the sanctions, offering to lift the most onerous restrictions on Russia\'s financial and energy sectors in exchange for Russia\'s implementation of the Minsk agreement. If the offer were accepted, it would constitute at best a minor success for U.S. sanctions policy: the Minsk agreement has been primarily the result of persistent diplomacy by French and German leaders, and U.S. sanctions were aimed at securing not just peace in eastern Ukraine but also unconditional Russian withdrawal from Crimea. Given the Kremlin\'s past unwillingness to compromise, however, such an offer would most likely be rejected. In that case, the United States should cut its losses and unilaterally lift the majority of the sanctions on Russia.As for the lower-cost sanctions aimed at specific, narrow goals, those may as well be kept in place. Travel bans on individual elites should last for several more years. These restrictions carry low costs--the burden of which falls primarily on governments, not businesses--and will continue to inconvenience elites close to Putin, hopefully deterring future aggressive actions to some extent. Sanctions on entities directly involved in the annexation of Crimea should also be retained, since they are aimed not at coercion but at preventing Russia from profiting from the seizure, a goal that is far more likely to succeed.Sanctions that impede Russia\'s military modernization have a role to play, too. Not only should the United States and Europe expand the long-term asset freezes and financing bans on Russian weapons manufacturers; they should also enact new bans on the import of arms from western Europe, particularly on major purchases, such as the Mistral helicopter carriers that Russia ordered from France before the deal was canceled in August 2015. None of these measures is likely to coerce Russian leaders into changing course in Ukraine, but they could make it trickier for Russia to engage in future military misadventures.  Mykola Lazarenko / Ukrainian Presidential Press Service / Handout via ReutersRussian President Vladimir Putin, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and French President Francois Hollande in Minsk, February 2015.After winnowing the sanctions, U.S. diplomats should seek to work with their Russian counterparts on issues unrelated to the Ukraine crisis. The United States and Russia collaborated on the Iran nuclear deal, and despite Russia\'s recent intervention in Syria, there is still room for cooperation on ending the civil war there. Although Washington and Moscow disagree about the future of the Assad regime, they both have an interest in preventing the growth of the Islamic State, or ISIS, and there is good reason for the two powers to try to craft a multilateral political solution to Syria\'s crisis. Engaging Russia on this and other non-Ukrainian issues would avoid isolating it diplomatically and thus discourage it from creating or joining alternative international institutions.  The United States should also give additional economic aid to Ukraine. Although any aid program must grapple with Kiev\'s long-running corruption and governance problems, increased assistance would help the Ukrainian government address its economic woes, rebuild from conflict, and ultimately become less economically dependent on Russia.Finally, to starve the Russian state of revenue in the long term, Washington should try to provide Europe with an alternative source of energy. Even though the United States is the world\'s biggest producer of oil and natural gas, U.S. federal law currently bans the export of crude oil, and the Department of Energy requires a special waiver for the export of liquefied natural gas. In October, the House of Representatives voted to lift these restrictions, but the president threatened to veto the bill. That\'s a shame, since the move would not only benefit U.S. companies and consumers but also allow European states to wean themselves off Russian oil and gas. As Russian energy companies lost customers, the state\'s revenues would decline. And unlike the sanctions, this policy would help, not hurt, European energy security.It is difficult to accept when a policy does not work. To its credit, the Obama administration has done so in Cuba, by resuming diplomatic relations, and in Iran, by choosing to negotiate. It is time to admit failure in Russia, too. Because the high costs of Western sanctions cannot be justified by their limited impact, the United States would be better off trying a policy with fewer downsides, and with greater odds of success.

S'Tarrow has spent most of his distinguished career exploring social movements and political conflict in western Europe. In this wide-ranging historical survey, he examines how "contentious politics"--draft riots, worker strikes, ethnic conflicts, civil rights movements, antiwar protests, and nationalist campaigns--have affected state building and war making in France, the United States, and Italy. During the French Revolution, domestic upheaval and war turned a "movement state" that proclaimed "the rights of man" into a military regime; French citizens regained their political rights only decades later, under the auspices of a centralized state. In the U.S. case, the Civil War strengthened the federal government and provided a catalyst for the abolitionist movement and the expansion of suffrage and citizenship rights. Italy entered World War I as a fragile liberal state, but faced with food shortages, labor strife, and antiwar protests, it succumbed to repressive military rule. In general, Tarrow sees the twentieth century as an era when foreign wars and geopolitical conflict tended to have a damaging impact on civil rights and citizenship, even in liberal democracies; the twenty-first century has seen a similar pattern, he argues, pointing to the consolidation of the "national-security state" and a semi-permanent war on terrorism. But his book is better at lamenting this development than explaining it. blank'

S"Tax avoidance (which is legal) and tax evasion (which is not) have been around ever since authorities began to levy taxes, as have attempts to influence the rules of taxation.

S"Pike's book is an extraordinary achievement; it is as definitive as any single-volume history of the Pacific War can be. As the title suggests, Pike does not let Japanese Emperor Hirohito off the hook for the battles fought in his name. Pike sets the fighting firmly in the context of the regional tensions that had been developing for some time before any combat took place, not least as a result of the Japanese invasion of China in 1937. The book covers all the major campaigns and battles of the war, from Pearl Harbor to Hiroshima, but also pays close attention to often overlooked topics, such as the Burma Campaign (which pitted the British and the Chinese against Indian, Japanese, and Thai forces) and the Chinese resistance to Japan. Pike's analysis is careful but never dry, and he pens lively portraits of his main characters. The book covers so much, and at such great length, that the publisher apparently was not able to include maps, illustrations, notes, or appendixes. Readers must visit a website for that material. This is regrettable: it would have been better to split the book into two volumes. blank"

S"From the mid-1970s until about 1990, when West Germany won the World Cup, its national team was a soccer powerhouse. Then German soccer collapsed. For a decade, the German team--which unified just after that World Cup victory, along with East and West Germany--did not proceed past the global quarterfinals, and in 2000, it was ejected from the European championships after having scored just one point. This book describes the comeback of German soccer, culminating in the team's victory at the 2014 World Cup. Honigstein, one of the world's top soccer columnists, describes how the German establishment came together to invest in soccer facilities, establish a national system of youth academies, reconstruct scouting and coaching systems, install state-of-the-art training equipment, and develop a cohesive national team spirit. The details of this story will thrill soccer lovers, but there is also an underlying lesson--a very European one. Excellence in sports, as in the arts, education, business, and many other things, is a social accomplishment. It is achieved through sensible institutional design and not, as many believe (especially in the United States), simply by getting incentives right and letting talented individuals do their thing. blank"

S'Since the trend toward rising economic inequality in the United States became apparent in the 1990s, scholars and commentators have heatedly debated its causes and consequences. What has been less evident is a vigorous positive discussion about what equality means and how it might be pursued.Up through the middle of the nineteenth century, Americans saw equality and liberty as mutually reinforcing ideals. Political equality, shored up by economic equality, was the means by which democratic citizens could secure their liberty. The Declaration of Independence treats the equal capacity of human beings to make judgments about their situations and those of their communities as the basis for popular government and identifies the people\'s shared right to alter or abolish existing political institutions as the only true security for their freedom. And Abraham Lincoln famously summed up the founding as the birth of a nation "conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal."As the historian James Hutson has shown, many of the founders understood the achievement of political liberty to require some meaningful degree of economic equality. One of the most important policy achievements of the era was the elimination in most states of primogeniture laws, a favorite cause of Thomas Jefferson. Thomas Paine advocated giving a cash grant to every man and woman on turning 21 and an annual pension to every person aged 50 and older, both to be funded through an estate tax. And even John Adams, who thought that the franchise should be limited to property holders, nonetheless believed that class should be defined as broadly as possible in order to avoid turning the new country into an oligarchy. In May 1776, he wrote to a fellow politician, "The only possible Way then of preserving the Ballance of Power on the side of equal Liberty and public Virtue, is to make the Acquisition of Land easy to every Member of Society: to make a Division of the Land into Small Quantities, So that the Multitude may be possessed of landed Estates."The founders didn\'t just espouse economic equality; they lived it. According to the historian Allan Kulikoff, at the time of the Revolution, more than 70 percent of white households in western counties, such as the Piedmont area of Virginia and newly settled regions of Maine, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and even New York, owned land. In eastern counties, property ownership had started to slip but still neared 60 percent. The new nation\'s successful development of political equality and liberty rested on a historically unprecedented level of economic equality within the white population.The country\'s leaders, moreover, chose to perpetuate this situation through public policy. The egalitarian land distributions arranged in the Northwest Territory through the land ordinances of the 1780s may be the most famous case, but they were not alone. From 1805 to 1833, for example, Georgia distributed most of its land to white men, widows, and orphans through random lotteries.But this, of course, is where the story turns sour. Where did Georgia\'s officials get that land to give away? From Native Americans, driven out of their homes thanks to the strenuous efforts of Andrew Jackson and others. Georgia\'s remarkably equal distribution of property is thus known by historians as "the Cherokee land lottery." Both the levelers among the founders and their critics agreed on where the wealth necessary for the new nation would come from: the expropriation of Native Americans, as well as from slave and indentured labor.When the French traveler Alexis de Tocqueville visited the United States in the early 1830s, he was struck by the egalitarian nature of the young nation--both in its culture and in the distribution of wealth. And many in those days recognized that in order for political equality to persist over time, it needed to be matched by some degree of economic equality. This is no less true today than it was then. Now, however, Americans must find a way to achieve such equality without relying on extraction and appropriation.LIBERTY VS. EQUALITYIn contrast to the early years of the republic, during which equality and liberty were understood to reinforce each other, by the middle of the twentieth century, it had become commonplace to invoke the idea of an "eternal conflict" between the two values, as a classic 1960 libertarian article put it. What happened in the interim? The rise of industrialization, which changed the balance of power among land, labor, and capital.Responding to the transformations they saw around them in the early days of the Industrial Revolution, Marx and Engels predicted in The Communist Manifesto that "the proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by degrees, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralize all instruments of production in the hands of the State." They continued: "Of course, in the beginning this cannot be effected except by means of despotic inroads on the rights of property and on the conditions of bourgeois production." Although Marx described his goal with the vocabulary of emancipation, his cause became linked to the ideal of equality--which soon lost its political meaning and came to be generally understood in economic terms. Economic equality thus came to be seen as something achievable only via "despotic inroads" on liberties such as the right to property. Fusing this with social Darwinism, the late-nineteenth-century thinker William Graham Sumner captured the new view succinctly: "Let it be understood that we cannot go outside of this alternative: liberty, inequality, survival of the fittest; not-liberty, equality, survival of the unfittest."    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display("dfp-ad-x90_2");    });    Wikimedia CommonsAn engineering company in Germany during the Industrial Revolution, 1868.The idea that liberty and equality are necessarily in conflict with each other became a staple of Cold War rhetoric that cast free-market capitalism (alongside religiosity) as the defining feature of the political system of the United States and totalitarian equalization (alongside atheism) as the defining feature of the Soviet Union.There are so few cliches about equality because Americans have spent so little time dwelling on the subject.In American public discourse, cliches abound for expressing what freedom means. "Give me liberty or give me death." "Don\'t tread on me." "It\'s a free country." "A man\'s home is his castle." "Doing what you like is freedom; liking what you do is happiness." But cliches about equality are much rarer, pretty much limited to "All men are created equal" and "One person, one vote." George Orwell argued that cliches indicate the corruption of thought by politics; speakers relying on them reveal an absence of original mental effort. But surely the absence of cliches indicates an even greater absence of thought. There are so few cliches about equality because Americans have spent so little time dwelling on the subject.SPHERES OF JUSTICEThe first task in any project of recovering an ideal of equality is to recognize that the concept requires further specification. When speakers invoke equality, do they mean moral, political, social, or economic equality? Even in the economic sphere alone, are they concerned with equality of outcomes or of opportunity? And what do they assume about the relationships among these different types of equality, or "spheres of justice," as the political theorist Michael Walzer has dubbed them?Moral equality is the idea that all human beings have the same fundamental worth and deserve the same basic protection of rights. The framework of international human rights law rests on and captures this idea.Political equality is the ideal that all citizens have equal rights of access to political institutions. It is most commonly defined as requiring civil and political rights--to freely associate and express oneself, to vote, to hold office, and to serve on juries. These are important rights, and protecting them from infringement is critical. But a richer notion of egalitarian empowerment would also consider whether society is structured so as to empower citizens to enter the fray of a politically competitive system. Questions about a right to education, for instance, would come in here, as would questions about campaign finance and electoral redistricting, which could impede the potential for truly democratic representation.Social equality involves the quality of social relations and associational life. Are neighborhoods integrated? Do equally qualified individuals have equal chances at jobs and valuable positions in society? During the civil rights movement, African American activists often had to set aside any claim to be pursuing social equality in order to get whites to support a project of securing political equality. The bargain was, to put it crudely, that the vote, the lunch counter, and public schools could be desegregated as long as that did not lead to greater rates of interracial marriage or social relations. Of course, that wasn\'t true, but at that point, explicit pursuit of social equality was a bridge too far. The Black Lives Matter campaign has now put the question of social equality squarely on the table, where it ought to have been all along.  Wikimedia CommonsDemonstrators in the Poor People\'s March at Lafayette Park and Connecticut Avenue in Washington, D.C., June 1968.Economic equality, finally, has come to the fore thanks to recent trends, with all the complexities and conundrums of its lack. There is now a broad consensus, for example, that straight equalization of economic resources can be achieved only at the cost of extreme, unjust, and counterproductive restrictions on personal liberty and a significant reduction of aggregate economic growth. This doesn\'t mean, however, that no egalitarian economic policy is possible, nor does it excuse us from trying to introduce into economic policy discussions notions of justice, fairness, and opportunity. The political philosopher John Rawls, for example, made compelling arguments that it is moral to pursue economic policies that generate inequalities, but only if they benefit the worse off in absolute terms, or at least do them no absolute harm.Treating each domain of equality on its own terms has its uses. But it is also important to treat them together, asking how they relate to one another and how they should be prioritized.POLITICS FIRSTThe early-nineteenth-century political philosopher Benjamin Constant famously argued that there was a critical difference between the liberty of the ancients and that of the moderns. The ancients, he averred, sought above all the freedom to participate in politics and to control their institutions, whereas the moderns preferred to be free from the burdens of politics in order to pursue their commercial enterprises and material pleasures. (Americans heard a strange echo of this argument when U.S. President George W. Bush, in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, called on them to continue their commercial activity in fulfillment of their civic duty.)We need a virtuous circle in which political equality supports institutions that, in turn, support social and economic equality.In modern mass democracies, it is indubitably harder to participate meaningfully in politics than it would have been in ancient Greek city-states or even republican Rome. This fact has led philosophers from John Stuart Mill to Isaiah Berlin to Rawls to accept the view that what we really need are experts who can set up a framework to protect citizens\' liberties and material interests while they go about the business of living as they choose.Yet this is to ask people to abandon the most powerful instrument available to them to effect their safety and happiness, namely politics. For if there is now a consensus that full equalization of economic resources would require extreme and costly restrictions on liberty, there is also now a consensus that there is no such thing as a totally free market. To function well, markets depend on rules, norms, and regulations, backed by law and the power of the state, and it is politics that determines what those rules, norms, and regulations will be. Politics trumps economics, in other words, or at least sets the terms according to which the economic game is played. So discussions of economic equality cannot be contained within the economic sphere alone and need to come back around, in the end, to the political sphere.Discussions of political equality, in turn, can and should bring economics into play, including the prospect of political contestation around issues of economic fairness. In other words, policies that secure political equality can have an effect on income inequality by increasing a society\'s political competitiveness and thereby affecting "how technology evolves, how markets function, and how the gains from various different economic arrangements are distributed," as the scholars Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson have noted. This is precisely the linkage the economist Amartya Sen called attention to with his research on the politics of famine in India, pointing out that there were some mass starvations under colonialism, despite the country\'s great agricultural fertility, but there have not been any under democracy.And there are other, even more important reasons for prioritizing political equality, such as the argument from moral equality that the best way to ensure that each person can be the author of his or her own life is by giving everyone an ownership stake in political institutions. Approaching egalitarianism through political equality rather than other routes leads to two further questions: How does one\'s status within the political realm relate to one\'s status in other spheres, and how can political equality itself be secured?HOW TO PROMOTE POLITICAL EQUALITYIn his treatment of the spheres of justice, Walzer argued for ensuring that one\'s status in each domain support, or at least not undermine, one\'s status in the other domains. We should seek economic and social policies, for example, that build a foundation for political equality, and as a result, even though we will not find ourselves strictly equal in the economic realm, or even the social one, a rough equality there could support our political equality and permit us to achieve a "complex equality" more generally. But what, precisely, is required of the relations among the three spheres?Political equality ultimately rests not on the right to vote or the right to hold office but on the rights of association and free expression. It is these rights that support contestation of the status quo, whether that is maintained by the government or by social majorities. The right to contract, meanwhile, is itself also deeply embedded in the right to association. But the moment that societies protect association, expression, and contract, as they must in order to protect human dignity at its most fundamental, they also secure two other phenomena: social discrimination and capitalism. Out of the right of association, socially differentiated groups form, and lines of difference can easily evolve into lines of division and domination. The requirements of political equality, in other words--freedom of association, expression, and contract--generate social phenomena that potentially jeopardize social equality and can lead to economic exploitation.How, then, can we build institutional frameworks in the social and economic domains that guide our associational practices in the direction of social equality and our economic practices in the direction of egalitarianism? We need a virtuous circle in which political equality supports institutions that, in turn, support social and economic equality--for without those frameworks, the result could well be the emergence of social castes or economic exploitation, either of which would feed back to undermine political equality.Rising to such a challenge is clearly difficult, but the basic issues involved can be sketched simply. The two fundamental sources of power in a democracy are numbers and control over the state\'s use of force. The media have access to eyeballs and ears, and therefore to numbers. Wealth, celebrity, and social movement organization can also provide access to eyeballs and ears. Wealth secures that access indirectly, by buying media resources; celebrity brings it directly. Organizing can also achieve such access, but only by dint of hard work. And wealth can also sometimes buy access to institutional control.  Many argue that the most important step needed to restore political equality now is to check the power of money in politics through campaign finance reform or to equalize the resources available to political actors by publicly subsidizing campaigns. They have a point, but by themselves such remedies are insufficient because they focus on only part of the broader picture. Reformers should be considering not merely how to check the power of money in politics but also how to rebuild the power of organizers and organizing as a counterbalance to wealth.A smart path toward this goal has been identified by the Yale law professor Heather Gerken, who argues for a new federalism that maps out consequential policy domains at all levels of the political system and supports citizen engagement at each level. Gerken\'s project is not about states\' rights; the federal rights enforcement structure would continue to establish the rules of the game for engagement at the local level. But she correctly points out that significant power resides throughout the various layers of U.S. politics and that there are rich egalitarian possibilities in all sorts of areas, from zoning, housing, and transportation to labor markets, education, and regulation. Policy contestation at the local and regional levels, she notes, can drive changes at the national level, with the case of marriage equality being only the most recent prominent example.Bolstering political equality throughout the lower and middle layers of the U.S. federalized political system is a not an easy or sexy task, but that is what is required to redress the outsize power of money in national life that has been both the consequence and the enabler of rising economic inequality. Liberty and equality can be mutually reinforcing, just as the founders believed. But to make that happen, political equality will need to be secured first and then be used to maintain, and be maintained by, egalitarianism in the social and economic spheres as well. '

S'In recent years, as public anxiety over growing inequality has intensified, policymakers and academics have started scrambling for some increasingly extreme solutions. India, for example, has launched massive programs to provide the poor with food and jobs, and the French economist Thomas Piketty has famously proposed a redistributive global wealth tax.But there are big problems with such efforts. Huge, heavily bureaucratic programs such as India\'s have proved inefficient and expensive. And the planet\'s richest citizens are certain to use all their influence to block any proposals along Piketty\'s lines from being implemented.The good news is that these and other radical solutions are also unnecessary. Over the last dozen years or so, one country--Brazil--has shown that there\'s a far better, less provocative, and more market-friendly way to fight inequality.Not long ago, the idea that Brazil might have something to teach the world about reducing inequality would have sounded like a joke. Latin America\'s largest nation had long been among the most unequal places on earth, a state synonymous with savage social injustice. The country may have been blessed with a large, youthful population and abundant natural resources, but for a long time, Brazil did as bad a job spreading its wealth as could be imagined. Even tiny, benighted Haiti was more equal.At the turn of the millennium, about a third of Brazil\'s population languished beneath the international poverty line.In the 1980s and 1990s, Brazil moved from dictatorship to democracy and embraced structural reforms that finally brought hyperinflation under control. But the mass of the population remained trapped in rural penury or urban favelas, while the fortunate few soared over the country\'s ungovernable megacities in private helicopters. At the turn of the millennium, about a third of Brazil\'s population languished beneath the international poverty line (surviving on $2 a day), and about 15 percent was indigent (living on less than $1.25 a day).Since then, however, a peaceful revolution has occurred. By 2011, the Brazilian economy was growing at a respectable four percent a year and unemployment had hit a record low--and for once, the benefits were actually being widely shared. In the first decade of the new century, some 40 million Brazilians moved from poverty into the middle class, per capita household income shot up by 27 percent, and inequality dropped dramatically--unlike in every other BRIC country (Russia, India, and China), where it rose. Today, Brazil still faces many challenges, from an economic downturn to corruption scandals to the end of the commodity boom. But the country\'s incredible success in reducing poverty and inequality can and should light the way for further progress, both there and abroad.THE RISE OF THE REVOLUTIONARYThe urbane Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil\'s president from 1995 to 2003, started his career as a leftist academic but governed the country as a centrist. So when, during the 2002 presidential campaign, it started to look as though he would soon be succeeded by Luiz Incio Lula da Silva, Brazil\'s elites and markets panicked.Lula, as he is universally known, has attained such iconic status today that it can be hard to remember just how scary he seemed--at least to the rich--when he first burst onto Brazil\'s political scene. A proud child of the country\'s destitute northeast, Lula had been born the seventh of eight children in the hardscrabble state of Pernambuco. His family was so hard up that the future president was forced to drop out of school after the second grade in order to make money shining shoes. At ten, he taught himself to read. At 14, Lula somehow worked his way into a factory, where he eventually lost his left pinky finger to a machine press. Then he got involved in Brazil\'s powerful labor movement and discovered his calling. Rising rapidly through the ranks of the Sao Bernardo do Campo Metalworkers\' Union, Lula became the organization\'s leader at age 30, and five years later--while the country was still ruled by a military dictatorship--he helped found the leftist Workers\' Party (PT) in order to give the downtrodden a voice on the national stage.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display("dfp-ad-x90_2");    });    Gregg Newton / REUTERSFernando Henrique Cardoso, then Brazil\'s president, with Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, then president of theWorkers\' Party,inBrasilia, January 2002.By 2002, Lula had already run for president--and lost--three times. Although he had never been a Marxist (unlike many of his PT comrades), his earlier campaigns had featured calls to nationalize industry and default on the country\'s debt. When he finally started climbing in the polls, such talk, along with his rough roots and his campaign promise to eradicate poverty within a generation, thoroughly spooked elites and investors at home and abroad. In the United States, Henry Hyde, the Republican chair of the House International Relations Committee, denounced him as a "pro-Castro radical." Goldman Sachs began publishing a "Lulameter" that purported to track the risks to investors should the PT win. Nervous foreign banks started cutting off credit. Brazil\'s fragile economy, which was just starting to pick up, went into a dive. The main stock index fell by 30 percent. Investors started dumping their Brazilian holdings, yanking more than $12 billion in capital out of the country within a few months. And the value of the real, Brazil\'s currency, fell by 40 percent against the dollar, hitting an all-time low toward the end of 2002.Yet enough Brazilians were sick of the country\'s feudal social structure and the pain caused by Cardoso\'s necessary but unpopular structural reforms and austerity measures that Lula won anyway. As the unkempt union man prepared to take office and the economy continued to crater, the country braced for the epic confrontation. But the cataclysm never arrived.Lula entered office plotting a revolution, but it was nothing like the one his conservative critics feared. Although Lula did enter office plotting a revolution, it was nothing like the one his conservative critics feared. His earlier defeats and the vicious reaction to his eventual victory hadn\'t weakened Lula\'s commitment to social change, but they had made him rethink how to produce that change. Between 1993 and 2001, he and Jose Graziano, an American-born agronomist who was one of Lula\'s closest advisers, had gone on extensive listening tours throughout the country, and the politician who emerged was far more moderate, conciliatory, and politically canny than his earlier incarnation. Lula had realized that he would never get far if he tried to govern on behalf of just part of Brazil. He needed to ensure that his revolution would benefit everyone.And so the rabble-rouser metamorphosed into the Great Conciliator. Lula banished all talk of debt defaults and wealth redistribution from his lexicon, recasting himself as what the Rio-based journalist Mac Margolis has called "the CEO-whisperer, amigo to the middle class, [and] champion of a rules-based market democracy." The move caused grumbling within the PT, but Lula held firm. On taking office, he pledged to preserve Cardoso\'s tight fiscal and monetary policies. Shortly after his inauguration in January 2003, he picked Henrique Meirelles--a well-regarded financial executive and Cardoso ally--to run Brazil\'s central bank and Antonio Palocci, another sober centrist, as finance minister. And then he started hacking away at Brazil\'s bloated national budget, cutting spending by about $4 billion in his first year and imposing an even stricter budget-surplus target than the International Monetary Fund recommended.The payoff was immediate. Many of the same antagonists who had attacked him during the campaign now swooned. In March 2003, Mohamed El-Erian, then managing director of the bond giant PIMCO, declared that the president\'s initial moves had been "very good," and the markets agreed. Within six months of Lula\'s inauguration, the value of Brazil\'s bonds rose by 20 percent, and even Goldman Sachs sheepishly admitted that its warnings had been wrong.  Marcos Brindicci / REUTERS  A boy plays with a soccer ball inside a supermarket in Recife, June 2013.          CASH AND CARRYAt the same time that Lula was wooing the moneymen, however, he was hard at work on another front, preparing to use his growing political capital to launch an ambitious new social welfare campaign. Rolled out a few months after his election, Fome Zero (Zero Hunger) eventually featured more than 40 different programs run by close to 20 government ministries. But one initiative stood at the campaign\'s core: Bolsa Familia (Family Grant), a poverty-fighting effort that was revolutionary in its size, ambition, and design.Rather than provide the poor with goods or services, as most development programs did at the time, Bolsa Familia would do something far more daring: simply hand out money. Brazil had actually started experimenting with this approach back in 1995, when the cities of Campinas and Brasilia had launched small cash-giveaway programs on a trial basis. These proved so effective that they were soon copied by more than 100 other local governments, and in 2001, Cardoso had begun testing a similar scheme on the national level (although the payments were tiny and the execution was flawed). Lula, acting on Graziano\'s advice, decided to roll all these various programs into a single new streamlined national initiative and to expand it to a scale far larger than even most experts had ever imagined possible.The idea proved hugely controversial, at least at first. At the time, most experts and international organizations still considered the notion of simply handing money straight to the poor to be dangerously wrong-headed. It just felt wrong on an intuitive level. It also flew in the face of decades of social science research and what the World Bank had long considered best practice. Yet three insights had convinced Lula and his advisers of the benefits of their new approach.First, Brazil\'s own experience had shown that large-scale attempts to alleviate poverty by distributing goods, such as a massive food program Cardoso launched in the late 1990s, generally flopped in an embarrassing and expensive fashion. Providing the poor with physical stuff is complicated, costly, and inefficient. It also requires a large bureaucracy, which creates endless opportunities for corruption--a perennial problem in Brazil.Second, a few academic studies (which would later be confirmed by a slew of follow-on research) had started to confirm what Lula, who disdained experts, already knew: that the people who best understood what the poor really needed were the poor themselves. When given the chance, destitute families generally didn\'t squander their windfalls. Most spent the money quite rationally--especially when the cash went to mothers, not fathers, as it would under Bolsa Familia. "It sometimes bothers my educated friends when I say this," Lula told me in late 2014,but the number one teacher in my life was a woman who was born and died illiterate: my mother. With all due respect to experts and academics, they know very little about the poor. They know a lot about statistics, but that\'s different, sabe? To an intellectual, putting $50 in the hands of a poor person is charity; an academic has no idea what a poor person can do with it. But that\'s because at university, they don\'t teach you how to care for the poor. And it\'s because most experts have never experienced what the poor go through every day. They\'ve never had to go to work without breakfast. They\'ve never lived in a flooded house, or had to wait three hours at a bus stop. To experts, a social problem like inequality is only numbers.Finally, Lula had also realized that the wave of privatizations that had swept Latin America in the 1980s and 1990s--as governments sold off everything from airlines and energy producers to utility providers--had left hundreds of millions of citizens stranded, too poor to participate in the expanding market economies. Lula and his advisers reckoned that, rather than go through the nightmare of renationalizing big businesses, the best and simplest way to reverse the poor\'s exclusion was to put a little cash in their pockets. So Lula decided to do just that.As the president and his aides devised the program, qualifying for assistance under Bolsa Familia would be simple. Any family that could prove that it lived in extreme poverty--then defined as earning less than 50 reais (about $42) per person per month--would be eligible for payments, as would moderately poor families that earned less than 100 reais per person.But if getting into the program would be easy, staying in it would take work. Participants would have to meet several conditions, or contrapartidas (counterpart responsibilities): ensure that all their children between six and 15 years old attended school at least 85 percent of the time, make sure that any of their children under seven got immunized, and guarantee that both mothers and children got regular medical checkups. (Pregnant women would also be required to get prenatal care and to breastfeed their infants.)Lula had two reasons for imposing such rules. He knew that while he himself might have managed to claw his way out of poverty by the tips of his nine fingers, he had been exceptionally lucky to do so. For most Brazilians, demographics were destiny: if you were born poor, you would die that way, too. Lula was determined to break the intergenerational trap by enabling--and requiring--parents to give their children greater advantages than they themselves had enjoyed, in the form of education, health care, and nutrition.  MARIO TAMA / GETTY IMAGESMoving on up: participants in the Bolsa Familia program, Rio de Janeiro, October 2013.Lula also knew that attaching strict conditions to his new aid program would make it easier to sell to the rest of society, something that would otherwise have been difficult. Prior to Lula, most social assistance programs in Brazil had taken the form of insurance schemes that dis-proportionately benefited the middle and upper classes. Bolsa Familia was the first time a Brazilian president had really put combating poverty and inequality at the center of his agenda (at least more than rhetorically), and that all but guaranteed a fight.THE BATTLE FOR BUY-INThe pushback started the moment the program was introduced in October 2003. Some economists argued that the government should be investing in infrastructure, such as schools, rather than paying people to have their children attend them. Others said that parents shouldn\'t be told what to do for their kids. And conservative pundits warned that the cash transfers would create welfare dependency. "The opposition said we were going to create an army of lazy people," Lula told me.Under Brazil\'s constitution, the president was able to launch a program such as Bolsa Familia on his own executive authority. But the law also stipulated that he needed congressional approval within a year in order to get it renewed. This meant that Lula would have to secure broad-based support if his signature program was going to survive--and the contrapartidas were his key to getting it. "The idea was to show that we are not giving out money for free," Lula explained to me. "We had to build trust, even among those who were skeptical about this kind of a program." As Ariel Fiszbein and Norbert Schady, two World Bank economists, have documented, the conditions helped Lula do that by creating the popular impression that Bolsa Familia was not some sop to the poor but rather a new sort of social contract with them, under which recipients had to do their part as well. Making beneficiaries show "clear evidence of commitment" to the "positive behaviors" required by the program made those beneficiaries seem more deserving, explained Fiszbein and Schady, giving the public the sense that they had earned the cash.Lula knew that attaching strict conditions to his aid program would make it easier to sell to the rest of society.Of course, simply announcing formal conditions wasn\'t enough; there also had to be consequences for noncompliance. To that end, Bolsa Familia\'s architects designed a system of graduated penalties for those who failed to do their duty. Rule breakers would get a warning; if they still didn\'t comply, their benefits would be suspended; and if the trouble continued, they\'d eventually get bounced out of the program altogether.While such sanctions looked good on paper, Lula soon learned the hard way that getting the public to take them seriously would require proof that the rules were actually being enforced. In 2004, the program\'s rapid expansion diverted effort and attention away from overseeing compliance with its requirements. Learning that only 55 percent of Brazil\'s public schools were even bothering to report on whether Bolsa Familia recipients were meeting their attendance quotas, the administration decided to suspend all monitoring temporarily. This decision might have made sense bureaucratically, since it bought the government time to get its house in order. But it proved to be a public relations disaster.Globo, an anti-Lula media conglomerate, saw the opportunity and pounced. Just a few days before nationwide municipal elections in October, Fantstico, a popular Sunday-evening news program on a Globo network, broadcast an investigative report alleging widespread abuse of Lula\'s flagship program by undeserving recipients. The rest of Brazil\'s media quickly jumped on the story, the public was incensed, and within a week of the broadcast, the government had received several thousand angry complaints.Sensing the danger, Lula decided to face his critics head-on. "What is the lesson we learned from this moment? Humility," he told me. "You have to recognize that a very big program will have mistakes. You have to admit them. And then you have to fix them." To that end, Lula set up the new Ministry of Social Development and Fight Against Hunger (known by its Portuguese abbreviation, MDS) to centralize oversight of Bolsa Familia. Departing from Brazil\'s long tradition of patronage politics, he staffed the new body with highly trained technocrats rather than partisan hacks. Then, in January 2005, he personally presided over the public launch of a sweeping new multiagency strategy for improving Bolsa Familia\'s implementation, including establishing a unified national registry to keep track of everyone who got assistance, centralizing Bolsa Familia\'s eligibility criteria, implementing audits and spot checks, setting up citizen oversight committees and complaint hot lines, and requiring that Bolsa Familia participants get recertified every two years.  Ueslei Marcelino / REUTERSBrazilian President Dilma Rousseff at a ceremony marking the tenth anniversary of the Bolsa Familia program in Brasilia, October 2013.By mid-2006, monitoring and enforcement had improved dramatically: in June of that year, the MDS cut some half a million ineligible recipients from its rolls. Brazilians noticed, and were impressed. The criticism ebbed, and public support for the program began to climb. Indeed, a 2010 analysis of polling data and media coverage by Kathy Lindert and Vanina Vincensini, two World Bank experts, found that by imposing rigorous conditions for assistance, Lula\'s government legitimized Bolsa Familia with Brazilian voters, generating widespread enthusiasm for it on both ends of the political spectrum.MONEY FOR (NEXT TO) NOTHINGAs useful as Lula\'s contrapartidas were in boosting Bolsa Familia\'s popularity, two other innovations would prove almost as important. First, for all its ambitions, Bolsa Familia was, and remains, cheap--radically so, compared with most other social welfare programs in Brazil and elsewhere. Today, more than a decade after its launch, Bolsa Familia reaches about 14 million families, which translates to about 55 million Brazilians--an enormous number. Yet because Lula and his advisers recognized that it takes only a small sum of money to make a big difference in a poor family\'s life, the individual payments (which vary according to income and family size) are tiny: the average family gets just $65 a month, and benefits top out at $200.As a result, "the amount spent on Bolsa Familia is nothing," says Yoshiaki Nakano, the director of the Sao Paulo School of Economics. That\'s an exaggeration, but not a big one. The fact is that one of the world\'s most ambitious antipoverty programs currently costs Brazilian taxpayers less than half a percent of the country\'s $2.3 trillion GDP, far less than the government spends on, say, pensions (a much more regressive support mechanism). Although precise international comparisons are hard to make, the evidence suggests that Bolsa Familia is one of the cheapest antipoverty programs anywhere. Indeed, a 2011 study by the British government found that thanks in part to their minimal administrative expenses, cash-transfer programs such as Bolsa Familia cost 30 percent less per person than more traditional aid programs.The program was also structured in such a way that it would ultimately benefit all Brazilians, not just those at the bottom. As Lula explained when he first introduced it, "When millions can go to the supermarket to buy milk, to buy bread, the economy will work better. The miserable will become consumers." By giving people money that they could spend however they wanted, Lula created what Lena Lavinas, a welfare economist at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, has called "a pro-market approach to combating poverty." Indeed, no less an authority than Jorge Castaeda, a former conservative foreign minister of Mexico turned columnist and scourge of the Latin American left, has called Bolsa Familia an "innovative welfare program" that is as "neoliberal . . . as one can get."Although the price tag for Bolsa Familia may be small, its impact has proved enormous. Not only has it reached more than a quarter of the overall population (and 85 percent of the poor), but the payments, tiny though they are, have doubled the incomes of Brazil\'s most destitute families. In its first three years, Bolsa Familia cut extreme poverty by 15 percent, and by 2014, the percentage of Brazilians living in indigence had been slashed to less than three percent--a level the World Bank considers equivalent to eradication. At the same time, Bolsa Familia has helped lift a total of 36 million people out of general poverty, producing what Matias Spektor, a political scientist and columnist for Brazil\'s biggest newspaper, Folha de S.Paulo, described to me as "the single largest ten-year change to a country\'s class structure since Japan after World War II."As for inequality, recent studies credit Bolsa Familia with having helped reduce the country\'s overall income gap by a third and rank the program as the second most important contributor to this change after general economic growth. According to Tereza Campello, the country\'s minister of social development, the income of the poorest 20 percent of Brazilians rose by 6.2 percent between 2002 and 2013, while that of the country\'s richest 20 percent grew by only 2.6 percent. (That stands in sharp contrast to the United States, where during the same period, the income of the richest ten percent rose by 2.6 percent, while that of the poorest ten percent shrank by 8.6 percent.) Although the Brazilian government has implemented a number of other important social support programs, including big hikes to the minimum wage, and although a growing economy helped matters, most experts agree that Bolsa Familia deserves a huge amount of the credit for the overall improvement in the lives of the country\'s poor. Bolsa Familia has also proved an important cushion as Brazil\'s growth has slowed in recent years. The country\'s overall economy may be hurting today, but thanks to the buffer provided by Bolsa Familia, the masses are not--or at least not compared to the way they suffered during the country\'s many past crises.Bolsa Familia has also made great strides toward Lula\'s goal of breaking the transmission of poverty from one generation to the next: by helping increase vaccination rates to 99 percent of the population, by decreasing malnutrition among children in Brazil\'s poorest regions by 16 percent, and by increasing their chances of having a healthy weight-to-age ratio by 26 percent. Infant mortality has dropped by 40 percent in the last decade, with deaths from malnutrition specifically down by 58 percent--one of the sharpest reductions ever seen anywhere. Meanwhile, the number of children forced to work instead of attending school has fallen by 14 percent. Bolsa Familia recipients now boast a graduation rate double that of poor Brazilian children outside the program, and the initiative is credited with improving school attendance in the country\'s poorest regions by 14 percent. One happy consequence: the national literacy rate has already risen.The program has also produced some less tangible and less predictable--although just as important--changes in the lives and attitudes of Brazil\'s poorest citizens. One recent survey found that by giving them authority over their families\' bank accounts, Bolsa Familia has empowered Brazilian women; for example, female Bolsa Familia participants are ten percent more likely to say that they have exclusive authority over contraception in their marriages. And the program seems to have had a dramatic impact on poor Brazilians\' sense of agency. A recent survey of 1,400 Bolsa Familia beneficiaries in three different cities found that rather than feeling stigmatized by their dependence on the government program, three-quarters of respondents said that they were proud to be enrolled and that, by allowing them to properly feed and clothe their children without having to beg, Bolsa Familia has helped them "lead more autonomous and dignified lives."Brazilians enrolled in the program even express increased faith in their country\'s democracy. That might seem an odd outcome for a welfare program, but as Lula explains, "Part of the reason Bolsa Familia has been so successful is because the money is paid directly, with no intermediary. It is the beneficiary who goes to the bank with a plastic card to withdraw the money. So this person doesn\'t owe any favors to the president, to their governor, to their congressman, or to their mayor." And the lack of middlemen also makes it hard, if not impossible, for officials to skim off the top.Since its launch, Bolsa Familia has increased Brazil\'s GDP growth by 1.78 reais for every one real disbursed.Finally, just as Lula promised, Bolsa Familia has provided a significant boost to the overall economy. By giving the poor more money to spend, the program has increased domestic consumption, an especially important economic driver in a country like Brazil, which shuns most imports. Although most of the money is spent on food, Lula says that "of the people that received benefits under the Bolsa, 80 percent of them bought a television set, 79 percent of them bought a refrigerator, and 50 percent of them bought a washing machine. So what had seemed like a program just for people who were living in eighteenth-century conditions helped meet the needs of modern manufacturers, generating millions of jobs. Everyone won." That may sound like boasting, but the numbers bear it out: economists calculate that since its launch, Bolsa Familia has increased Brazil\'s GDP growth by 1.78 reais for every one real disbursed.SOMETHING FOR EVERYONEThese accomplishments have made Bolsa Familia incredibly popular in Brazil; recent polls put its approval rating at around 75 percent. "Today everybody\'s happy," Lavinas told me. "The poor because they are less poor, and the rich because the program is so cheap that they don\'t care." Even the middle class, traditionally the most conservative segment of Brazil\'s electorate, has embraced Bolsa Familia. As Spektor explains, this group "grew up in a country that was always getting worse. As Brazil democratized [in the mid-1980s], violence went up, inequality went up, inflation went up. We were geared toward thinking things were awful. If you hoped for a future, you wanted to learn English and get the hell out of here. Now, suddenly, I\'d rather be here than anywhere else. And that\'s thanks to Bolsa."Seeing how popular the program is and how much it did to help Lula\'s political fortunes over the years, virtually all other Brazilian politicians have rushed to embrace it. Dilma Rousseff, Lula\'s successor, has expanded the program\'s reach and upped its benefits several times. She even launched an initiative called Busca Ativa (Active Search) that sends intrepid social workers to the country\'s most remote corners--sometimes by jungle boat--in search of more needy Brazilians to enroll in the program. Meanwhile, during the 2014 election, both of her opponents promised to extend Bolsa Familia still further. To do otherwise would have been "political suicide," says Thiago de Aragao, a political consultant in Brasilia.None of this enthusiasm means that Bolsa Familia is perfect. Although the program has helped Brazil make historic progress, the country still remains far too unequal. Under Rousseff, economic growth has ground to a halt and the country\'s debt has soared. And despite Bolsa Familia\'s massive reach, about 28 million Brazilians still live in poverty. Some experts worry that by focusing so intensely on the needs of Brazilian children, the program neglects their impoverished parents (whose benefits drop precipitously when their children reach 17). Feminist scholars such as Maxine Molyneux of University College London caution that "by making transfers conditional on \'good motherhood,\'" initiatives such as Bolsa Familia reinforce traditional gender roles. And Lavinas, among others, points out that while the Brazilian government has done a good job getting kids into school, it has done far less to improve the education they receive there--one of many reasons massive numbers of Brazilians took to the streets to protest poor government services in 2013.Bolsa Familia\'s positive impact is also undermined by Brazil\'s regressive tax system, which relies excessively on consumption tariffs. These fees, which cover virtually every imaginable good and many services, eat up a big share--as much as 55 percent, by some estimates--of Bolsa Familia stipends. Finally, financial analysts attack Bolsa Familia for reducing inequality at the expense of overall growth, and some Brazilians still insist the cash transfers only make people more dependent on the dole.  Certainly, Bolsa Familia can and should be improved. Brazil also desperately needs tax, health-care, and educational reform, as well as greater investment in infrastructure. But a wealth of evidence contradicts at least some of the critics\' charges. Government statistics show that 75 percent of adult Bolsa Familia recipients do work, for example, and generally those who don\'t, can\'t--because they live in areas with too few job opportunities.It should come as no surprise, then, that despite its imperfections, the program has attracted wide admiration abroad as well as at home. Nancy Birdsall, the president of the Washington-based Center for Global Development, has called Bolsa Familia "as close as you can come to a magic bullet in development." Other boosters range from The New York Times (which dubbed Bolsa Familia "likely the most important government anti-poverty program the world has ever seen") to The Economist (which declared it "a stunning success").Perhaps the best testament to the brilliance of Bolsa Familia\'s design, however--as well to the defiantly unorthodox, something-for-everyone approach Lula used to formulate and then sell it--is the fact that since the program\'s creation, more than 63 countries have sent experts to Brazil to copy its model. Within just a few years of Bolsa Familia\'s inception, in fact, the MDS was so swamped by all the foreign requests for advice that it began holding twice-yearly seminars on how to launch similar programs elsewhere. As of this writing, at least 40 states have taken that step, including most of the countries of Latin America, as well as Bangladesh, Indonesia, Morocco, South Africa, and Turkey (to name just a few). There have even been some copycat programs deployed in U.S. cities, such as Memphis and New York--more proof, if it\'s needed, of the global appeal of Brazil\'s great experiment. '

S'The scholar Edward Corwin famously described the separation of powers between the executive and the legislative branches set out in the U.S. Constitution as "an invitation to struggle for the privilege of directing American foreign policy." With different parties controlling different branches of government, partisan politics tends to intensify this struggle, and the consequences can be ugly. These days, for example, hardly a week seems to go by without vicious sniping between the Obama administration and Republicans in Congress over one issue or another--from China to Russia, Iran to Syria, Cuba to Israel. And on most issues, process as well as discourse has broken down, with each side openly trying to thwart or bypass the other.This is not the first time things have descended to such a level. What the current situation most resembles, in fact, is the early Cold War era, when Republicans in Congress made foreign policy central to their attacks on President Harry Truman. Then, as now, the GOP condemned a Democratic president for being too soft, letting down key allies, and leaving the nation ill equipped to deal with its adversaries. And then, as now, congressional hard-liners sought greater control over foreign policy, proposing all manner of resolutions and hearings to rein in and embarrass the president.The historical parallel is not exact--they never are--but a look back at the earlier strife offers useful context for evaluating today\'s bitter divisions and their likely outcome. The main takeaway is not comforting to contemporary Republicans: trying to fight a no-holds-barred war over foreign policy against a determined White House can limit the effectiveness of U.S. efforts abroad and discredit those who launch what can come to be seen as obstructionist assaults.THE GOOD OLD DAYSIronically, the Republican challenge of the late 1940s and early 1950s followed one of the most productive periods of bipartisan cooperation in congressional history. Between 1947 and 1949, the Truman administration worked closely with the Republican-dominated 80th Congress to pass some of the central components of containment. Just weeks after Truman laid out a vision for an interventionist foreign policy against Soviet influence in March 1947, Congress appropriated $400 million so that Greece and Turkey could confront internal communist threats. After the Truman Doctrine came the Marshall Plan, an even more ambitious initiative that provided $13 billion for the reconstruction of Western European economies devastated by World War II.Many Republicans, including Senator Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan (who wielded impressive power over his party\'s rank and file), supported these measures because they had become committed internationalists in the wake of Pearl Harbor. Truman\'s sweeping rhetoric on the Soviet threat also helped. The story that Vandenberg instructed Truman to "scare the hell out of America" to win Republican support might be apocryphal, but it contains a kernel of truth: Truman did use hyperbolic language to sell containment, and he conspicuously failed to place geographic limits on where such a strategy would apply.Still, Truman\'s Republican outreach worked only up to a point. The Truman Doctrine mobilized Republican support, but it also gave the president\'s opponents the opportunity to attack him when he failed to live up to its principles. Both Democrats and Republicans agreed that Western Europe had to be protected from Soviet influence, for example, but when the Cold War spread to Asia, Truman proved more reluctant to aid regimes that he considered corrupt, such as the Chinese Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek. Republicans took advantage of Truman\'s perceived failure to act on his word to contain communism on every front: Senators Styles Bridges, William Knowland, and Kenneth Wherry, for example, claimed in a memorandum inserted in the Congressional Record that the president was pursuing a "wishful, do-nothing policy which has succeeded only in placing Asia in danger of Soviet conquest."For his part, the intensely partisan Truman never grew comfortable working with Republicans, especially those in the party\'s nationalist wing, who hoped to limit both the size of the U.S. government and its long-term global commitments. Indeed, he invited Robert Taft--an Ohio senator who so epitomized GOP conservatism that he was dubbed "Mr. Republican"--to the White House only twice during his presidency. And rather than negotiate privately with his critics, Truman chose to attack them publicly, culminating in the "whistle-stop tour" of his 1948 reelection campaign, when he traveled the country by train and relentlessly lambasted the "do-nothing" Republican Congress.Republicans were initially unconcerned by the criticism, since they considered Truman an accidental president who lacked the charisma and gravitas for the top job. New York Governor Thomas Dewey, their candidate for the presidency, was so confident of victory in the 1948 election that he scarcely challenged Truman\'s foreign policy during the campaign season. Then the votes were counted, and Dewey lost in the Republicans\' fifth straight defeat.So the Republicans returned to Washington in 1949 in a surly mood. Many in the GOP concluded that their cooperation with the Democratic White House on foreign policy had consigned their party to the political margins. With Vandenberg sick with cancer, leadership on Capitol Hill passed to senators in the party\'s nationalist wing, such as Taft, Bridges, and Wherry. And the days of bipartisan cooperation shuddered to a halt.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display("dfp-ad-x90_2");    });  SCARE TACTICSIn the years after 1949, Republicans made a concerted effort to depict Truman and the Democrats as weak, especially on communism in Asia--a charge that both the nationalist and the internationalist wings of the party initially embraced. Truman, Republicans insisted, had "lost" China to Mao Zedong by refusing to provide sufficient help to Chiang in the Chinese Civil War. Even worse, they claimed, Secretary of State Dean Acheson had given the "green light" for North Korea to invade South Korea in June 1950 by publicly excluding South Korea from the U.S. defense perimeter earlier in the year.When Truman responded to the North Korean attack by deploying four U.S. divisions to the peninsula, Republicans hardly rallied around the flag. Taft began by claiming that the administration\'s weak Asia policy had effectively "invited" the invasion. Then, as U.S. troops retreated south in disarray, Republican lawmakers charged that Truman had wasted taxpayers\' dollars on domestic projects while so neglecting the nation\'s defenses that the U.S. military could not even halt the North Korean army. The name-calling often got ugly. Wherry declared that "the blood of our boys in Korea" was on Acheson\'s "shoulders, and no one else"--a statement Truman considered "contemptible."In November, after the Inchon landing and then China\'s entry had whipsawed the course of the war back and forth, this name-calling turned into something more sinister. Some Republicans went so far as to portray the partisan tensions as a contest between loyal Americans and actual and potential traitors. Senior Republicans began to consider the possibility of impeaching both Truman and Acheson for treasonable actions, and South Dakota Senator Francis Case even introduced a bill to abolish the State Department.A year earlier, Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy had already begun escalating policy disputes to ones of character and patriotism, alleging that card-carrying Communists had infiltrated the State Department. As the Korean War ground on, McCarthy widened his sights. He dubbed Acheson a tool of Moscow and encouraged him to flee to Russia. He also accused George Marshall, the U.S. secretary of defense, of selling out American interests to the Communists.The virulence of McCarthy\'s indictments worried many Republicans, including Taft, who privately described his colleague as a "hard man for anybody to work with, or restrain." Yet when trying to forge a Republican position on McCarthy\'s allegations, Taft and other GOP leaders allowed partisanship to override their private qualms. McCarthy, Taft believed, should "keep talking, and if one case doesn\'t work out, he should proceed with another," until he eventually succeeded in tarnishing the reputation of Truman and the Democrats.  Wikimedia CommonsSenator Josephy McCarthy, 1954.In the midst of an increasingly unpopular and eventually stalemated war, it was easy for the Republicans to attack the Democrats as weak. But it was far harder to develop a coherent alternative policy. The logic of the Republican critique pointed in the direction of military escalation--going big seemed marginally preferable to going home--and many in the party\'s nationalist wing found an icon in General Douglas MacArthur, who had rejected his commander in chief\'s relative restraint, had called for taking the war to China in pursuit of victory, and was ultimately fired by Truman in April 1951. After MacArthur\'s passionate farewell address to Congress, Republican Representative Dewey Short from Missouri remarked, "We saw a great hunk of God in the flesh, and we heard the voice of God."Yet when Republicans began to analyze MacArthur\'s actual policy advice, its appeal faded. As a rhetorical device, accusing the president of weakness had its merits, but as the basis for a new policy, it presented obvious problems. Republicans from both wings of the party were already indicting Truman for the growing death toll of his limited war, and many nationalists were convinced that the war in Korea was consuming too many tax dollars. Did they really want to escalate a conflict that Taft, in July 1951, described as a "useless and expensive waste"?Truman aimed to limit American involvement in Korea partly because he thought Europe was the most important Cold War battleground. But he also wanted time to implement NSC-68, the secret policy document produced by the State Department that outlined a stepped-up containment plan. Taft and his conservative allies balked at the cost of this program, which Truman had candidly indicated would be funded in part by increased taxes. And as the implications of NSC-68 became clearer, some Republicans recoiled from what they saw as an emerging "garrison state," one that proposed not only to force young men into a system of universal military training but also to impose wage and price controls.Along with an overweening state, many Republicans feared a highhanded president they saw as bent on bypassing constitutional checks on his authority. When Truman decided to send U.S. forces to Korea without asking Congress for a declaration of war, for example, Taft charged, "There is no legal authority for what he has done." And in December 1950, when the president decided to send four additional divisions to bolster NATO in Europe rather than confront the Chinese intervention in Korea, many Republicans challenged his authority to do so without their consent. Their cause quickly gathered support across the aisle, and in early 1951, a bipartisan coalition passed a nonbinding resolution opposing the deployment of further U.S. troops to Europe "without further congressional approval." By then, the charge that Truman\'s foreign policy threatened the letter and spirit of the Constitution had become a central feature of the Republican challenge to the president.As the basis for a new policy, accusing the president of weakness had obvious problems.Increasingly frustrated by their inability to effect changes in U.S. policy through persuasion, moreover, hard-line anti-interventionists in Congress decided to try establishing procedural restraints on the White House instead. The most famous of these was the so-called Bricker Amendment, a series of measures designed to bring the White House to heel by placing explicit restrictions on the scope and ratification processes of treaties and executive agreements. Named after their sponsor, Ohio Senator John Bricker--a staunch conservative who had been Dewey\'s running mate in 1944--the measures were intended as protection against the supposedly sneaky attempts of executive-branch globalists to abandon their country\'s age-old freedoms. Their text included language such as "a provision of a treaty which conflicts with this Constitution shall not be of any force or effect" and "Congress shall have power to regulate all executive and other agreements with any foreign power or international organization." A version Bricker introduced in February 1952 got 58 cosponsors in the Senate, including every Republican but one.THE PARTY OF YESBy the 1952 presidential election, however, the nationalist challenge had begun to fizzle. Truman had managed to get his way on most foreign policy questions, waging a limited war in Korea without congressional approval and using the war to mobilize U.S. power for a long-haul struggle to contain the Soviet challenge. And the election of Dwight Eisenhower--a quintessential internationalist and avatar of the Republican Party\'s establishment wing--was a victory for the GOP but a defeat for its nationalist faction. Increasingly concerned about the prospect of a Taft candidacy, mainstream Republicans had flocked to Eisenhower as a moderate with bipartisan appeal.  Wikimedia CommonsPresident Eisenhower, left, with Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, 1956.During the campaign, Eisenhower promised only modest changes to Truman\'s foreign policies, both on Korea and on containment more generally, pledging merely to bring more competence and frugality to their implementation. Once in office, moreover, he viewed a major task of his administration as teaching his party to govern after 20 years in the presidential wilderness. Republicans in Congress, he observed, had become so used to dealing with a Democratic president that their instinct was to automatically oppose any policy proposed by the White House. "Now that we have a Republican Congress their job is to hold up the hands of the executive departments," Eisenhower told his cabinet in early 1953, "but they have not learned that yet. . . . Their automatic thinking is to tear them down."Fortunately for Eisenhower, because the GOP had been out of power for so long, even its nationalist leaders were prepared to mute their instinctive oppositional traits, not to mention their deep-seated aversion to key elements of Eisenhower\'s foreign policy agenda. Taft himself performed a valuable service shortly before his death in July 1953 by helping bottle up the Bricker Amendment in committee. And other influential Republicans reluctantly agreed to support an armistice agreement that ratified the stalemate in Korea, something many in the party had initially opposed because it fell short of an outright U.S. victory.Partisanship on foreign policy can backfire and criticism from the sidelines is easier than policymaking in power.By 1954, cooperation between Democrats and Republicans was returning to Washington. When McCarthy continued with his increasingly wild efforts to root out supposed Communists throughout the government and armed services, his own party finally decided to repudiate him. And by the time the Democrats regained control of Congress in the 1954 midterm elections, Eisenhower had not only quelled the worst excesses in the Republican ranks but also forged a constructive working relationship with the Democratic leadership, led by powerful southerners such as Texas Senator Lyndon Johnson. The bipartisan consensus that followed would prevail until the Vietnam War.BACK TO THE FUTUREThe constructive cooperation between a moderate Republican president and southern Democrats in Congress during the mid-1950s shows how much U.S. politics has changed over the generations. Back then, both parties were internally divided along ideological and regional lines; today, they are much more homogeneous. President Barack Obama, like Truman before him, has shown little aptitude for reaching across the aisle, yet given the distance between the parties on so many issues, it is doubtful that any president could bridge the contemporary chasm. Still, there are some lessons to be learned from the earlier era, chief among which is that perceived partisanship on foreign policy can backfire and criticism from the sidelines is easier than policymaking in power.During the 1950s, nationalist Republicans ended up getting minimal political payoffs for their attacks on the Truman administration, with Taft himself emerging as the biggest loser: he desperately sought the presidency for years, but his aggressive politicking on foreign policy became an insurmountable obstacle. Taft\'s willingness to hammer the administration at every opportunity and in every way--including the use of the particularly blunt instrument of McCarthy--worried many in his party, who in turn worked to block his presidential nomination in 1952. And the more that Taft and his allies condemned Truman for his weakness, the more they raised the stakes for themselves to offer a plausible alternative, which they never really had.Indeed, however unappetizing a limited war in Korea was, the prospect of either abandoning the peninsula to the Communists or fighting a full-scale war with China was much worse. And although the Truman administration\'s apparently passive policy toward communist advances in Asia became an easy target, the notion of aggressively pursuing "rollback" contained obvious risks. The American public certainly had little stomach for increased belligerence or adventurism in the wake of a long, stalemated war fought halfway around the world. And so Republicans desperate to win back the White House gradually dropped their confrontational approach and eventually sided with Eisenhower\'s moderation.  A belligerent foreign policy stance, moreover, fit uncomfortably with the Republican Party\'s advocacy of smaller government, lower taxes, and fiscal responsibility. A muscular posture abroad, after all, would require a higher budget, which in turn would require either higher taxes or higher deficits, both of which were anathemas to many in the GOP. Taft\'s railings against Democratic weakness, for example, lost much of their force when, in 1951, he began pledging to cut U.S. defense spending by half and claimed that Truman\'s proposals for a 3.5-million-man army would wreck the economy. (The Eisenhower administration eventually tried to square this circle by promulgating its "New Look" policies, including massive retaliation, which supposedly promised more bang for the defensive buck, but the actual changes to U.S. national security policy came only at the margins.)Nationalist Republicans\' policy proposals, finally, tended to provoke fear and loathing from major U.S. allies. Truman\'s domestic critics regularly accused him of selling out the country\'s friends abroad, but the friends the critics had in mind tended to be small, weak countries with high political salience back home, such as Taiwan and South Korea. What the critics generally ignored was that Truman\'s efforts to put in place a robust, well-resourced containment of the Soviet Union without triggering an actual war were supported and appreciated by the country\'s larger and more strategically important allies, such as France, Japan, the United Kingdom, and West Germany. Nationalist Republicans\' rash rhetoric often spooked Washington\'s truly indispensable partners, who feared the prospect of escalation in Korea, looked askance at McCarthy\'s campaign to root out internal Communists, and fretted about the consequences of excessive congressional control over U.S. foreign policy.If the 1950s are any guide, therefore, one might expect to see the punches that come thick and fast in the midst of a partisan campaign over foreign policy land far from their intended targets and quite possibly end up hurting those who throw them in the first place.

S'Last October, the European Court of Justice struck down the Safe Harbor agreement, a 15-year-old transatlantic arrangement that permitted U.S. companies to transfer data, such as people\'s Google-search histories, outside the EU. In invalidating the agreement, the ECJ found that the blurry relationship between private-sector data collection and national security in the United States violates the privacy rights of EU citizens whose data travel overseas. The decision leaves U.S. technology companies with extensive international operations on shaky legal ground.Although some informed American observers anticipated the decision, most were caught flat-footed; some seemed downright bewildered. Myron Brilliant, the executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said, "It is particularly alarming that this long-standing agreement has been invalidated with no discussion of a transition period or guidance regarding how companies should comply with the law." Critics of the decision, including U.S. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker, argue that it will jeopardize the transatlantic digital economy, costing U.S. firms billions of dollars. Without a new agreement, there is a significant risk that personal data will have to be quarantined within Europe, creating what Eric Schmidt, the executive chair of Alphabet (previously Google), called "per-country Internets." If that occurred, he continued, it could risk destroying "one of the greatest achievements of humanity." Critics also charge that the EU is acting unilaterally to protect its businesses against foreign competition, damaging the open, democratic nature of the Internet.But the main reason that U.S. companies and officials are flustered is that they are used to being the ones who make the rules. Over the past 70 years, the United States has built a global system in which information, investment, and trade move quickly and easily across borders. That openness has created an interdependent world in which the national rules and preferences of one country can shape the rules and preferences of others. The outsized power of the U.S. economy usually gives that role to the United States.In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the United States began to exploit interdependence, deliberately using its economic power as an instrument of national security. Despite advocating the free flow of capital, it has systematically used sanctions to obligate foreign banks and financial actors to isolate businesses, people, and states from the global financial system. Despite publicly promoting an open and secure Internet, it has privately undermined the encryption of online communications and surreptitiously created vast international surveillance systems in cooperation with close allies, including the United Kingdom. In short, the United States has leveraged the world\'s reliance on its economy to influence and spy on foreigners.This strategy is reaching its limits, and the Safe Harbor decision powerfully demonstrates that Washington needs to wake up to the strategy\'s costs. When the United States uses its global economic heft to bolster its national security, it rigs the game, making it nearly impossible for other states to push back and inspiring ill will abroad. It is difficult for EU countries to fight back directly, both because of the sheer might of the U.S. security apparatus and because EU member states free-ride on U.S. intelligence, military, and technological capabilities. Yet the EU may have found a way to force the United States to pay a price for its dominance. Although the ECJ has no jurisdiction over the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), it does have jurisdiction over the European operations of American firms. Its ruling demonstrates that the more Washington tries to leverage the interdependence of the global system for its own security goals, the more other states and their courts will actively resist a U.S.-centered global economy.WEAPONIZING INTERDEPENDENCEOne of the great luxuries of hegemony is the ability to take the world for granted. U.S.-led globalization has removed barriers to the free flow of money, goods, and information. Removing these barriers has come with political costs, but these have been borne primarily by other states, which have been obliged to adjust their domestic rules so that they may benefit from the open, integrated world economy.A more integrated world economy benefits U.S. companies, allowing them to find new markets and build complex international supply chains that lower their costs. Businesses such as Facebook, Google, and Uber have exploited economic openness to replicate their business models throughout the advanced industrialized world, often deliberately challenging local and national rules in other countries. At the same time, the explosion of cross-border exchange has increased the importance of the U.S. dollar and the U.S. market as foreign firms seek access to American banks and consumers to raise money and sell goods.By transforming technology companies into tools of national intelligence, Washington has damaged their reputations.In the past decade and a half, Washington has increasingly wielded this power as a weapon, shaping the decisions of foreign governments and firms that depend on access to the United States\' currency, information sector, and markets. Rather than spread U.S. norms and preferences through indirect market mechanisms, the United States has directly harnessed the coercive might of its markets and information networks to achieve its own security and foreign policy goals--most notably combating transnational terrorism and confronting rogue states.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display("dfp-ad-x90_2");    });  Great powers have regularly used blockades, export restrictions, and sanctions to manipulate countries that depend on trade in physical goods. But the United States now has the power to manipulate financial and informational flows as well. Foreign financial institutions are crucially dependent on U.S.-dollar-based transactions, making them vulnerable to U.S. regulators, who can threaten them with dire consequences if they do not comply with U.S. rules. In an effort dubbed "Treasury\'s War" by one of its chief architects, Juan Zarate, who served during the George W. Bush administration as assistant secretary of the U.S. Treasury for terrorist financing and financial crimes, the United States has pressed foreign financial institutions into service as agents of Washington. Under Section 311 of the U.S.A. Patriot Act, the U.S. Treasury Department has the ability to classify a foreign financial institution as a "primary money laundering concern." This classification can affect a bank\'s ability to operate in the United States and allows Washington to pressure other financial institutions affiliated with it that rely on U.S. markets.  Arnd Wiegmann / ReutersPeople walk past a logo next to the main entrance of the Google building in Zurich, March 2011.Some of the United States\' targets, among them Iran and North Korea, have few sympathizers. But the United States has also undercut its friends. In the service of counterterrorism, for example, it forced a Belgium-based financial-processing entity to provide it with a trove of information on worldwide electronic fund transfers, systematically breaking EU privacy law. It has also exploited global interdependence to push foreign governments to change their domestic rules and practices on issues seemingly unrelated to security, such as bank secrecy, foreign bribery, and money laundering. Swiss banks, which have long made it their business model to help the world\'s wealthy avoid paying taxes, now find themselves in the cross hairs of U.S. national security policy. As U.S. officials have woken up to the importance of the financial flows that fund terrorist networks, they have begun to target illicit banking practices.THE END OF THE LINEToo often, policymakers in Washington mistakenly assume that the narrow self-interests of the United States and its businesses should automatically go hand in hand with the global order they have helped create. When foreign regulators have sought to apply national rules to U.S. technology companies, the United States has accused them of having ulterior motives. U.S. President Barack Obama, for example, has interpreted foreign governments\' efforts to protect their citizens\' rights against U.S. companies as protectionism in disguise. Speaking in a February 2015 interview about European investigations into Facebook and Google, he said, "Our companies have created [the Internet], expanded it, perfected it in ways they [Europeans] can\'t compete [with]. And oftentimes what is portrayed as high-minded positions on issues sometimes is just designed to carve out some of their commercial interests."Such claims are both wrong and politically unsustainable; soon enough, major states and jurisdictions will stop tolerating U.S. coercion. When the United States targets states or individuals that are perceived as breaking the rules, such as Iran or Russia, it can usually persuade enough other states to join in, giving its actions a veneer of legitimacy. But when the United States breaks the rules itself in ways that undermine the basic constitutional guidelines of other countries, it should expect a backlash. The more the United States seeks to exploit the system it has created, the more foreign states and businesses will challenge it.Interdependence has already begun to work against the United States rather than for it. As U.S. businesses have entered international markets, they have become more vulnerable to other countries\' rules and more anxious about U.S. policies and actions that irritate other governments. This is an especially big problem for technology companies, whose insatiable hunger for detailed personal information indirectly feeds the U.S. surveillance state. Since foreign countries cannot directly indict the NSA, they tend to turn to the targets whose behavior they can affect--U.S. businesses--to force the U.S. government to change its rules.FOR EU EYES ONLINEThanks to the revelations of the American privacy activist and former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, resentment toward the U.S. security state has grown into active opposition. Snowden\'s files showed that the United States, together with key allies, had systematically exploited technical vulnerabilities to spy on the world, gathering vast amounts of data on the personal communications of hundreds of millions of people and combing them for relevant security information. This meant that even as Washington had spent years advocating an open Internet and condemning digital surveillance by countries ranging from China to Russia, it had simultaneously been exploiting the open Internet on the sly. The United States had publicly proselytized for the free flow of information while secretly diverting these flows into NSA server farms. It had vigorously supported the global expansion of technology companies, championing the use of Twitter, for example, in pro-democratic movements such as those of the Arab Spring, while quietly requiring some of those firms to turn over troves of data and tapping into their servers overseas.Of course, the United States is not alone in its cynicism. Some politicians who have publicly expressed fury at the Snowden revelations, including German Interior Minister Thomas de Maizire, have hypocritically tried to impose similar surveillance schemes on their countries\' own civilians, and foreign intelligence agencies that depend on the CIA have minimized the scandal for fear of being cut off from U.S. intelligence-sharing programs. However, as U.S. actions have interfered with the basic rights of citizens abroad, they have drawn the ire of a different set of actors who are less easily cowed than politicians: judges, who often see their role as protecting fundamental constitutional protections rather than striking international compromises. The ECJ has already struck down a measure requiring European communications firms to keep customer data for up to two years, in part because it feared that this information might leave the EU. Now the court has gone one step further, challenging the basis of the transfer of personal information from the EU to the United States.The United States should recognize that globalization comes in different flavors and that Europeans have real and legitimate problems with ubiquitous U.S. surveillance and unilateralism. The Safe Harbor dispute stems from the fact that the EU and the United States have fundamentally different understandings of how privacy should work in the digital age. Beginning in the 1990s, European countries developed comprehensive rules governing the collection and processing of personal information, overseen by independent regulatory agencies called "data protection authorities." This approach to privacy was elevated to a fundamental constitutional right when the EU adopted its Charter of Fundamental Rights in 2009. The United States, in contrast, lacks a comprehensive approach to privacy, relying instead on an idiosyncratic patchwork of specific--and, in some cases, dated--rules governing sectors as diverse as health care and video rentals. The problem for the United States is that European regulations have long prohibited the transfer of data to countries that the EU considers to have weak privacy protections, among them the United States.Given the economic benefits of data exchange, the EU and the United States negotiated the Safe Harbor agreement in 2000 to work through these differences. As part of the arrangement, U.S. firms agreed to comply with a set of basic privacy principles overseen and enforced by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In the past 15 years, more than 4,000 U.S. firms have come to rely on Safe Harbor to facilitate transatlantic e-commerce and to transfer data across jurisdictions. The ECJ\'s ruling jeopardizes all of that.In the wake of the Snowden revelations, privacy activists in Europe began exploring legal channels to curtail U.S. surveillance. In 2013, Max Schrems, an Austrian law student, brought a case in Ireland against the Safe Harbor agreement based on information revealed in the Snowden files. He argued that the NSA\'s spying showed that there was no effective data protection regime in the United States and that the Safe Harbor agreement could not protect European citizens from mass surveillance. Ireland\'s High Court appeared to agree, finding that "the Snowden revelations demonstrate a massive overreach on the part of the security authorities, with an almost studied indifference to the privacy interests of ordinary citizens. Their data protection rights have been seriously compromised by mass and largely unsupervised surveillance programmes." The ECJ, in its ruling, cited the Irish High Court\'s findings on the Snowden documents and directly tied the fate of the Safe Harbor program to the blurring of private-sector data collection and public surveillance in the United States, concluding thatnational security, public interest, and law enforcement requirements of the United States prevail over the safe harbour scheme, so that United States undertakings are bound to disregard, without limitation, the protective rules laid down by that scheme where they conflict with such requirements. The United States safe harbour scheme thus enables interference, by United States public authorities, with the fundamental rights of persons.  Leonhard Foeger / ReutersAustrian data activist Max Schrems talks to the media in the courthouse after his trial against Facebook in Vienna, April 2015.NO SILVER LININGBy transforming U.S. technology companies into tools of national intelligence, Washington has badly damaged their corporate reputations and exposed them to foreign sanctions. Their international profits--not to mention a substantial chunk of the U.S. economy--depend on the free flow of information across borders. Foreign officials, political activists, and judges who limit these flows to protect their citizens from U.S. surveillance strike at the heart of these companies\' business models. The ECJ\'s Safe Harbor ruling has now forced Washington to decide whether it values its unrestricted ability to spy on Europeans more than an open Internet and the economic well-being of powerful U.S. businesses. The EU has, in effect, used the United States\' own tactics against it.Meanwhile, U.S. firms have few attractive long-term options if they want to transfer data across the Atlantic. In the short term, EU rules still allow businesses to use contracts, for example, to transfer personal data to the United States. But such transfers are no better protected against U.S. state surveillance than Safe Harbor transfers were. Hamburg\'s data commissioner has bluntly advised firms not to rely on these mechanisms and instead to simply keep their data on European servers.European data protection authorities have given Washington a few months\' reprieve to shape up but have threatened to take action if the United States has not reformed its privacy rules by the end of January 2016. They are demanding that the EU and the United States agree on a binding legal arrangement, such as a treaty, that guarantees European privacy rights by keeping data from U.S. intelligence agencies. If the United States does not amend its laws to protect Europeans, U.S. firms will likely need to Balkanize their data flows by quarantining European data in European data centers; otherwise, they will face sanctions from European data protection authorities. Microsoft\'s president, Brad Smith, warns that such fragmentation of the Internet risks a "digital dark ages" that could disrupt everything from credit-card payment systems to airline reservations, costing companies billions of dollars and threatening their global ambitions. U.S. efforts to exploit interdependence will have led Europe to cut valuable personal data out of global networks and markets.A NEW WORLD ORDERBy its very nature, interdependence can be a weakness as well as a weapon. As the Safe Harbor case illustrates, when the security preferences of the United States are at odds with the fundamental rights of citizens in other major jurisdictions, it is likely to face backlash. The United States needs global cooperation on a host of sensitive issues, ranging from money laundering and sanctions to the multilateral exchange of data. Yet it continues to insist on unilateralism, even when this damages the ability of U.S. firms to operate across jurisdictions.In the context of a criminal investigation, for example, the United States is now demanding that Microsoft hand over personal data housed in its data center in Ireland. Rather than requesting the data through the ordinary processes of intergovernmental exchange, in which the U.S. government would make a request to law enforcement officials in Ireland, the United States is using the global reach of its legal system to demand the data even in the face of opposition from both the Irish government and Silicon Valley companies that fear this move will further blacken their corporate reputations. A group of powerful technology giants, including Apple and Cisco Systems, has filed a "friends of the court" brief in support of Microsoft and against the U.S. government\'s position. If this type of behavior on the part of the U.S. government continues, it will critically damage the aspirations of U.S. firms to build global cloud computing. Instead of a common cloud, firms will have to make use of segmented national data spaces hidden behind thickets of regulations and mutually incompatible cryptographic protection schemes. This will both threaten cloud providers\' economies of scale and hurt U.S. providers that are seen, rightly or not, as more vulnerable to U.S. surveillance and the government\'s demands for information.But such an outcome can still be avoided. The EU and the United States share broadly similar values and have figured out how to cooperate on the exchange of law enforcement data. They have reached the so-called Umbrella Agreement, under which the United States has committed to introducing laws that will give the citizens of EU states certain privacy rights in U.S. courts. The United States could likely resolve the Safe Harbor controversy by extending such protections to cover surveillance and eliminating loopholes that allow both American and European intelligence agencies to exchange information without democratic oversight. Disputes such as the Microsoft case could be resolved through a more efficient system of multilateral exchange, with accompanying privacy protections. Many of the problems of interdependence could be solved by making civil rights interdependent as well, so that they are recognized and protected across multiple jurisdictions.  The United States faces a profound choice. It can continue to work in a world of blurred lines and unilateral demands, making no concessions on surveillance and denouncing privacy rights as protectionism in disguise. Yet if it does so, it is U.S. companies that will suffer.Alternatively, it can recognize that globalization comes in different flavors and that Europeans have real and legitimate problems with ubiquitous U.S. surveillance and unilateralism. An ambitious strategy would seek to reform EU and U.S. privacy rules so as to put in place a comprehensive institutional infrastructure that could protect the privacy rights of European and U.S. citizens alike, creating rules and institutions to restrict general surveillance to uses that are genuinely in the security interests of all the countries.More broadly, the United States needs to disentangle the power of a U.S.-led order from the temptations of manipulating that order to its national security advantage. If it wants globalization to continue working as it has in the past, the United States is going to have to stop thinking of flows of goods and information as weapons and start seeing them as public goods that need to be maintained and nurtured. Ultimately, it is U.S. firms and the American economy that stand to benefit most. '

S"For readers seeking to understand the antiestablishment rage fueling the right-wing populism of today's Republican Party, Murray's book serves as an indispensable introduction. In articulating a conservative vision of limited government, Murray emphasizes how entrenched interest groups have exploited weaknesses in legislative, regulatory, and electoral processes to produce a state that has grown inexorably larger, less efficient, and more corrupt. He strengthens the force of his polemic by pointing mostly to examples of Republican corruption and Republican surrenders to special interests. Murray argues that the rot has gone so far that it cannot be halted by conventional means, and he recommends a strategy of selective civil disobedience to limit the reach and power of the regulatory state. As the country finds itself gripped by a wave of transformational economic change, Murray seeks a path for domestic reform that can appeal to the political center as well as Tea Party populists. (His book briefly but approvingly cites some of my own writings on these themes.) Few American writers understand the forces that drive Republican discontent as well as Murray; this book is the best available guide to the next stage of U.S. politics. blank"

S'This is a sensible, well-documented study of how jihadist organizations recruit young Britons, perhaps because it relies on sound data to understand the perspective of the extremists. Pantucci convincingly rebuts common explanations for the rise of militant Islam among British youth, such as economic exclusion and the influence of hard-line clerics. He points instead to three linked factors: identity, grievance, and mobilization. Jihad offers a way to for young immigrants (or the children of immigrants) to blend their various ethnic identities. These young people oppose British nationalism yet do not really feel that they belong to any other country. Fighting for an internationalist cause thus offers a way to answer the question, "Who am I?" This opens the door for grievances: the more Western countries become involved militarily in the Islamic world, particularly in ways that kill civilians, the more young British Muslims see defending their foreign coreligionists as a legitimate goal. The third factor is the existence of a mobilizing network of recruiters, today usually functioning online. In the United Kingdom, these recruiters espouse violent versions of either Salafi or Deobandi ideologies. blank'

S"This interesting book is written by economists mainly for economists, but it includes many entertaining stories about business behavior (and some disturbing ones), told in lively and accessible prose. Its central message is that the concept of the competitive market as a socially optimal arrangement, as conveyed by the typical college-level economics textbook, is not merely too reductive but actually fundamentally wrong. The profit motives that usefully lead businesses to compete in pricing and innovation also lead them to appeal to their customers' baser instincts and even to deceive people into making purchases; the snake oil salesmen of a century ago are still around today, just in different forms. The authors argue that the risk comes from the fact that misleading tactics often work and that they can become systematic. Economists and others need to be aware of this as they frame policy goals. blank"

S"In this masterly account of some of the most formative events of the ancient world, Rahe describes how the Greeks resisted the military might wielded by the Persian emperors Darius and Xerxes during the Greco-Persian Wars of the fifth century BC. Rahe puts the Spartans at center stage, providing a vivid description of their society and politics: militaristic in ethos but cautious in diplomacy. The Spartans played a crucial role in forging the Hellenic alliance that repelled the Persian invaders, and their bravery and military talents were critical to such victories as the famous defense of the pass at Thermopylae in 480 BC. Rahe sets the story in a complicated geopolitical context, with a large cast of characters connected through a series of shifting alliances. But his relaxed, even jaunty style and his thorough analysis sustain the narrative and hold the reader's attention. And his appreciation of the practicalities of ancient warfare--from the challenge of managing large numbers of horses to the difficulty of maneuvering triremes, the chief naval vessels of the era--adds credibility to his accounts of the key battles. blank"

S'Marine Le Pen, the energetic leader of France\'s anti-immigrant and anti-EU Front National (FN), has quickly become one of Europe\'s most influential and visible leaders. After a strong showing in the 2014 European Union elections in France and in the first round of regional elections earlier this month, Le Pen\'s party looked set to take office accross much of France. Yet as voters went to the polls on Sunday, opposition to FN rule galvanized. In the end, the party failed to win even one regional presidency.But despite FN\'s electoral losses, its ideology is gaining popularity across the country. The influx of migrants and refugees, growing fear of radical Islam, lackluster economic growth, and lingering unemployment have called into question national identity, multiculturalism, and the efficacy and purpose of the European Union--not just in France, but region-wide. In turn, ultra-nationalist parties such as the FN have become more powerful, with worrying repercussions.As one of the European Union\'s most powerful actors, France is perhaps one of the most striking examples of what happens when xenophobia mixes with the challenges of traditional politics. French citizens feel increasingly excluded from government decisions because, as FN would put it, policies are "imposed" by the European Union, socialists have "abandoned" the working class, and the distance between rulers and the electorate has widened. The party\'s supporters fear that their nation is in decline because the influence of globalization on national values, economic turmoil, and Germany\'s unchallenged influence on Europe, and are grappling with the growing threat of Islamist extremism, exemplified by the November terrorist attacks in Paris. In turn, many have lost faith in standard political parties. Compared to previous regional elections, Socialists and their coalition have lost 6 percent of their vote share, and the center-right about 4 percent. And here, Le Pen has seized an opportunity, laying the blame for France\'s parties at the feet of conventional politicians, while offering hypothetical protection for native citizens and domestic industries. In many ways, this may be summarized with a flagship concept such as "national preference" (French citizens come first) and the slogan La France d\'abord! Most importantly, FN promises to regain lost national pride by reducing immigration, closing state borders, imposing national protectionism in the economic sector, and abandoning many transnational agreements and governing bodies.If France is unique in its obsession with national history, exceptionalism, and grandeur, the right-leaning nationalist phenomenon that embodies this obsession is by no means limited to French politics. Since Jean-Marie Le Pen\'s first successes with FN in the 1980s, many other movements have tried to adopt similar discourses, and found inspiration in Le Pen\'s words. Today, these far-right-wing groups proliferate at party and non-party level throughout Europe.A EUROPEAN PHENOMENONThe rise of nationalist parties in Europe has made the continent\'s center-right nervous. Many rightist parties have responded to the challenge by adopting more conservative and protectionist platforms. Hungary, Poland, and the United Kingdom, for example, have taken tougher stances on refugees and EU politics, and have amplified their rhetoric on national values and customs. British Prime Minister David Cameron, for example, has offered a referendum on EU membership, while continuously trying to propose tougher rules for EU citizens seeking to move to and work within the UK. This represents a strong challenge to an important pillar of European integration--free travel enjoyed by Europeans.  Jean-Paul Pelissier / ReutersA supporter walks on a placard to support Marion Marechal-Le Pen, French National Front political party member and candidate for National Front in the Provence-Alpes-Cote d\'Azur (PACA) region, after results in the second-round regional elections in Marseille, France, December 13, 2015.The European center-left, meanwhile, has responded by dismissing the nationalist parties rather than by standing against their policies and platforms outright, when not adopting policies that partially legitimize the far-right. France\'s present socialist government has not, for example, showed a lot of sympathy toward migrants and refugees arriving from Italy and the others staying in Calais. This is nothing new, especially in France: For example, French socialist Prime Minister Laurent Fabius argued in 1984 that the FN posed, on immigration, "good questions," to which it merely gave the "wrong answers."In fact, on some issues, parties across the French political spectrum have been more aligned than not. Immigration is one example, though Le Pen shows the most radical approach. One very recent FN leaflet went straight to the point: "Stop  la submersion migratoire"-- Stop the migration submersion.Meanwhile, the center-right Les Republicains party, led by former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, has touted online surveys that demonstrate support for limiting France\'s social benefits programs for immigrants. At the same, Sarkozy has opposed visa-free travel within Schengen Zone because he believes that refugees coming through Greece will target France for its social provisions. On September 16, he even suggested that migrants be given a "temporary" non-political refugee status that would require them to return home when the conflicts in their origin states end.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display("dfp-ad-x90_2");    });  These sentiments have even been echoed by some French left-wing intellectuals. The economist Jacques Sapir, for example, denied that FN is "xenophobic." Further, he has called for a unified "national front of liberation" against the euro--a coalition of French political parties from across the political spectrum that oppose France\'s neoliberal agenda both domestically and internationally.Others are even more outspoken in defending the far-right. The philosopher and self-declared libertarian socialist Michel Onfray openly criticizes Islam, and has suggested that the FN is not responsible for the turmoil in European politics. Rather, Onfray blames the European Union for undermining French sovereignty, and the traditional right and left for political strife.  Eric Gaillard / ReutersSupporters paste a poster of Marine Le Pen, France\'s National Front leader, on a wall before a political rally for local elections in Frejus March 18, 2014.TURN RIGHTAcross Europe, social democracy has become synonymous with overspending in the public sector and on welfare. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras\' dreams of a post-austerity Greece have been dismissed as impossible, and British Labour Party head Jeremy Corbyn has widely been lampooned since his appointment as unelectable due to his anti-austerity political platform.  In turn, Europe will instead see more nationalistic and right-leaning policies in the years ahead. Throughout France and elsewhere, calls for reduced immigration seem realistic, along with attempts to limit the free movement of people, benefits reductions to EU migrants, the promotion of national sovereignty. And in terms of economic and political integration, as previously suggested, the United Kingdom soon faces a referendum on staying in the European Union. A poll commissioned by The Independent in late-November showed a majority of UK voters supporting an EU exit, even though the director of the Bank of England suggests that the country has benefitted from its membership.In all this, France finds itself at the forefront of this nationalist Europe; in fact, the FN has been something of a vanguard since the 1980s. Despite an evident softening of some FN politicians and their talking points, the party platform is no less radical and ultra-nationalist than it was in the past. For example, it is against the loss of French language purity, for a renegotiation of the European Convention on Human Rights, and rejects the Schengen Agreement and the principle of free movement in order to wrest control of its own borders. Last but not least, the party also calls for dismantling of the euro, as it sees the currency as a "symbol of federalist European politics."These European far-right parties, which have benefited from the rising inequality, high unemployment, low electoral turnout, and increasing popular stances of nationalism, in fact, prescribe an anti-global, and anti-EU agenda. These policies may seem appealing during troubling times, even if it means that states are less equipped to tackle problems. Others from more moderate and left-wing parties have also accepted these solutions. But those who have backed these nationalist parties\' agendas have implicitly helped building a "Fortress Europe" that is doomed to fail. If a true progressive alternative does not emerge, then France and other European nations must brace themselves for years of success of far-right political policies. '

S'In 2005, the UN General Assembly unanimously adopted the doctrine of "the responsibility to protect" (R2P), requiring governments to safeguard their citizens against mass atrocities and authorizing the international community to act if they do not. In theory, R2P redefines long-standing norms of sovereignty and nonintervention. In practice, however, R2P remains an elusive goal, as revealed by this collection of essays, the best account yet of the philosophical and practical difficulties that bedevil R2P. Gareth Evans, one of the doctrine\'s intellectual architects, contributes an incisive account of the origins and rise of the R2P idea and argues that despite setbacks, it is slowly emerging as a guiding principle. Edward Newman contends that the legitimacy of R2P ultimately hinges on the procedures used to authorize international action. Jean-Marc Coicaud looks at R2P through the lens of the recent crises in Gaza, Syria, and Ukraine, showing how the norm can be hijacked for cynical purposes. And Jonathan Graubart offers the most far-reaching critique, arguing that R2P merely provides great powers with a new justification for pursuing traditional military interventions. blank'

S'The failure of the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations, which began in 2001, has led to a proliferation of smaller multilateral and bilateral talks aimed at reaching narrower agreements. The United States is involved in two major ones: the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which involves 12 countries in the Asia-Pacific region that agreed to terms late last year but have yet to ratify the deal, and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which Washington is hashing out with the 28 members of the EU and hopes to complete later this year. This book provides a reasoned analysis of the TTIP in mid-negotiation, critically examining arguments made by its advocates and its critics, most of whom are in Europe. The authors\' sympathies lie mainly with the detractors, although they find the claims of both sides exaggerated. They are especially doubtful that the deal will add 0.5 percent to Europe\'s GDP by 2027, as its proponents predict, or that it will establish new "gold standard" trading rules for the rest of the world. They are troubled by the way that international trade has taken priority over other worthy objectives and allege that a successful TTIP negotiation will actually impinge on democratic decision-making in the future. blank'

S"Western governments and many prominent Western academics buy the idea that the best way to influence China's human rights policies is through informal diplomatic discussions about individual cases and Chinese laws rather than through public means, such as sanctions and UN resolutions. Kinzelbach exposes this as a myth. Employing remarkable interviews and archival and historical research, she builds a convincing case that this quiet approach is not only useless but also counterproductive. She shows how the Chinese cleverly employ closed-door sessions with the EU not only to deflect Western criticism but also to train rising officials in how to counter it in public. Kinzelbach faults the EU's decentralized structure and its analysts' naivete for Europeans' misplaced faith in private dialogue. But this seems insufficiently cynical: she assumes that eu states actually want to prioritize an effective human rights policy toward China and are willing to pay a price for it. But perhaps they simply seek to deflect their own domestic political pressure to play tough with China. Still, this is not just the best study of Western human rights policy toward China and of informal human rights dialogue in print; it is also one of the best microanalyses of a sensitive contemporary policy issue that I have ever read. blank"

S'The EU used to be a polity without politics, because none of the issues it handled were salient to most European voters. That changed forever when the union undertook an ill-advised intervention in monetary policy by creating the euro and then sticking with it through the financial crisis. Those decisions have had disastrous consequences for public trust in and support for the EU, which have plummeted in the years since. Most subsequent commentary has focused on the technocratic details of eu monetary policy and banking regulation. Cramme and Hobolt bring together some leading academic minds to puzzle through deeper questions. Is the EU politically sustainable? If so, in what form? What are the implications of the euro for democratic participation? In general, the contributors are skeptical that the EU will be able to put itself back together again in anything like its previous form, but they remain equally skeptical of radical reform. Anyone interested in the future of Europe should read this book. blank'

S"In 1187, the Muslim sultan Saladin defeated the crusader armies at the Battle of Hattin, restoring Muslim rule over Jerusalem and other places that the European Christian forces had captured during the preceding century. Yet Saladin's victory did not lead to the complete expulsion of Christians from the region, and in fact, it prompted further bouts of crusading. In this book, which is part of Oxford's Great Battles series, France reveals how divisions among the Christian leadership led to the slaughter at Hattin and explains how the battle has shaped the legacy of the Crusades. For one thing, many medieval Europeans came to see Saladin as a noble and worthy opponent--in some respects more honorable than the men he defeated. In more recent times, Saladin's image has been appropriated by Arab and Muslim leaders such as Saddam Hussein, who have claimed to emulate the sultan's leadership. blank"

S'Since the early 1990s, daily life in poor countries has been changing profoundly for the better: one billion people have escaped extreme poverty, average incomes have doubled, infant death rates have plummeted, millions more girls have enrolled in school, chronic hunger has been cut almost in half, deaths from malaria and other diseases have declined dramatically, democracy has spread far and wide, and the incidence of war--even with Syria and other conflicts--has fallen by half. This unprecedented progress goes way beyond China and India and has touched hundreds of millions of people in dozens of developing countries across the globe, from Mongolia to Mozambique, Bangladesh to Brazil.Yet few people are aware of these achievements, even though, in aggregate, they rank among the most important in human history. In 2013, the Swedish survey organization Novus Group International asked Americans how they thought the share of the world\'s population living in extreme poverty had changed over the last two decades. Sixty-six percent of respondents said that they thought it had doubled, and another 29 percent said that it hadn\'t changed. Only five percent knew (or guessed) the truth: that the share of people living in extreme poverty had fallen by half.Perhaps that ignorance explains why Washington has done so little to take advantage of these promising trends, giving only tepid support to nascent democracies, making limited investments in economic development and in new health and agricultural technologies, and failing to take the lead in building more effective international institutions. Whatever the reason, many developing countries are now responding to what they perceive as the United States\' indifference by looking elsewhere--especially toward China--for deeper engagement and advice on how to keep growing. At the same time, climate change, the slowdown in global growth, and rising tensions in the Middle East and beyond have begun to threaten further progress. As a result, the United States now risks missing out on a historic chance to strengthen its global leadership and help create a safer, more prosperous, and more democratic world--just at the moment when it could help the most.ONE GIANT LEAPGlobal poverty is falling faster today than at any time in human history. In 1993, about two billion people were trapped in extreme poverty (defined by the World Bank as living on less than $1.90 per day); by 2012, that number had dropped to less than one billion. The industrialization of China is a big part of the story, of course, but even excluding that country, the number of extreme poor has fallen by more than 400 million. Since the 1980s, more than 60 countries have reduced the number of their citizens who are impoverished, even as their overall populations have grown.This decline in poverty has gone hand in hand with much faster economic growth. Between 1977 and 1994, the growth in per capita GDP across the developing countries averaged zero; since 1995, that figure has shot up to three percent. Again, the change is widespread: between 1977 and 1994, only 21 developing countries (out of 109 with populations greater than one million) exceeded two percent annual per capita growth, but between 1995 and 2013, 71 such countries did so. And going backward has become much less common: in the earlier period, more than 50 developing countries recorded negative growth, but in the later one, just ten did.The improvements in health have been even bigger. In 1960, 22 percent of children in developing countries died before their fifth birthday, but by 2013, only five percent did. Diarrhea killed five million children a year in 1990 but claimed fewer than one million in 2014. Half as many people now die from malaria as did in 2000, and deaths from tuberculosis and AIDS have both dropped by a third. The share of people living with chronic hunger has fallen by almost half since the mid-1990s. Life expectancy at birth in developing countries has lengthened by nearly one-third, from 50 years in 1960 to 65 years today. These improvements in health have left no country untouched, even the worst-governed ones. Consider this: the rate of child death has declined in every single country (at least those where data are available) since 1980.Meanwhile, far more children are enrolling in and completing school. In the late 1980s, only 72 percent of all primary-school-age children attended school; now, the figure exceeds 87 percent. Girls in developing countries have enjoyed the biggest gains. In 1980, only half of them finished primary school, whereas four out of five do so today. These leaps in education are beginning to translate into better-skilled workers.Then there is the shift to democracy. Prior to the 1980s, most developing countries were run by left- or right-wing dictators. Coups and countercoups, violence and assassinations, human rights abuses--all formed part of regular political life. But starting in the 1980s, dictators began to fall, a process that accelerated after the Cold War. In 1983, only 17 of 109 developing countries qualified as democracies, based on data from Freedom House and the Center for Systemic Peace; by 2013, the number had more than tripled, to 56 (and that\'s not counting the many more developing countries with populations of less than one million).As those numbers suggest, power today is far more likely to be transferred through the ballot box than through violence, and elections in most countries have become fairer and more transparent. Twenty years ago, few Indonesians could have imagined that a furniture maker from central Java would beat one of Suharto\'s relatives in a free and fair election, as Joko Widodo did in 2014. Nor would many have predicted that Nigeria, then still under military rule, would in 2015 mark its first peaceful transfer of power between parties, or that Myanmar (also called Burma) would hold its most successful democratic election the same year. Across the developing world, individual freedoms and rights are honored to a much greater degree, human rights abuses are rarer, and legislative bodies have more power.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display("dfp-ad-x90_2");    });  Global poverty is falling faster today than at any time in human history.Yes, many of these new democracies have problems. And yes, the march toward democracy has slowed since 2005--and even reversed in some countries, such as Thailand and Venezuela. But in many more--from Brazil to Mongolia to Senegal--democracy has deepened. Never before in history have so many developing countries been so democratic.As states have become wealthier and more democratic, conflict and violence within them have declined. Those who think otherwise should remember that as recently as the 1980s and early 1990s, much of the world was aflame, from Central America to Southeast Asia to West Africa. There were half as many civil wars in the last decade as there were in the 1980s, and the number of people killed in armed conflicts has fallen by three-quarters.Three major forces sparked this great surge in development progress. First, the end of the Cold War brought an end to the superpowers\' support for some of the world\'s nastiest dictators and reduced the frequency of conflict. As ideas about economic and political governance began to change, developing countries introduced more market-based economic systems and more democracy. Second, globalization created vast new opportunities for economic growth. Increased flows of trade, investment, information, and technology created more jobs and improved living standards. Third, new and more effective leaders--in politics, business, religion, and civil society--began to forge deep change. Where courageous figures, such as Nelson Mandela in South Africa, stepped forward, countries progressed; where old-style dictators, such as Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe, remained in power, countries languished.This incredibly wide-ranging progress should not obscure the considerable work that remains: progress has not reached everyone, everywhere. One billion people still live in extreme poverty, six million children die every year from preventable diseases, too few girls get the education they deserve, and too many people suffer under dictatorships. Countries such as Haiti, North Korea, Uzbekistan, and Zimbabwe lag far behind. But the fact remains that an enormous transformation is under way--one that has already substantially improved the lives of hundreds of millions of people.WIN-WINThe United States should welcome and encourage this progress. For starters, broad-based development enhances global security. It is not true that poverty necessarily breeds terrorism, as some argue--after all, most poor people are not terrorists, and many terrorists are not poor. But it is true that poor states tend to be weak states unable to prevent terrorist and criminal networks from operating on their soil. Sustained development strengthens government institutions and reduces the need for outside intervention. As former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates put it, "Development is a lot cheaper than sending soldiers."Development also builds states\' capacities to fight pandemic disease. Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone were overwhelmed by Ebola in 2014 largely because they all had weak health systems. The same was true in many of the countries hit hardest by the HIV/AIDS epidemic decades ago. As poor countries grow wealthier, however, they become better equipped to fight diseases that can spread quickly beyond their borders.  2Tango / ReutersMedicins Sans Frontieres (MSF) health workers at an isolation camp for Ebola victims in Monrovia, Liberia, August 2014.A more prosperous developing world also benefits the U.S. economy. The spread of economic growth creates new markets for American businesses not just in China but also in Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa, and beyond. Developing countries are buying more and more aircraft, automobiles, semiconductors, medical equipment, pharmaceuticals, consultancy services, and entertainment. Although the growth in trade with developing countries has slowed during the last year, their economies will no doubt remain major market opportunities for U.S. companies. In 1990, such states accounted for one-third of the global economy; today, their share is half, and they purchase more than half of U.S. exports. In 2011, Walmart spent $2.4 billion to acquire a controlling share of a holding company that operates more than 350 retail stores in South Africa and 11 other African countries, signaling a level of interest in African consumers that would have been unimaginable two decades ago.To be sure, emerging markets also create competition for U.S. businesses and hardship for American workers who lose their jobs as a result. But they also create many new jobs, as American firms expand abroad and as companies in the developing world send more capital to the West. Moreover, developing countries are increasingly coming up with their own innovations and technologies, in medicine, agriculture, energy, and more. The United States should respond to this growing competition not with protectionism but by strengthening its own capacities: rebuilding its infrastructure, improving its educational system, and investing in new technologies.Finally, development helps spread and deepen the values that Americans hold dear: openness, economic opportunity, democracy, and freedom. These values tend to go hand in hand with growing prosperity: as incomes rise, citizens demand greater freedoms. History suggests that even governments that do not welcome these ideas eventually embrace them or are replaced by those that do. And as more developing countries achieve progress under market-based economic systems and democracy, other countries seek to emulate the model. The United States and Europe have a strong self-interest in encouraging this process, since it will enhance global stability and add to the number of like-minded partners that can help address future challenges.SUSTAINING THE SURGEWhat makes all this progress especially impressive is that it has continued despite a number of major shocks that in an earlier age could well have stopped it: the outbreak of the HIV/AIDS pandemic in the 1980s, the Asian financial crisis in 1997-98, the 9/11 attacks, the global food crisis of 2007-8, and the global financial crisis of 2008. In each case, pundits predicted that the disaster of the day would set back progress. Yet in each case, the gains continued.There are good reasons to believe they can continue well into the future. The forces that sparked these changes were fundamental, not transitory. Governments have learned from their mistakes and gotten much better at managing inevitable downturns. Global integration has made critical technologies available to more and more people. State institutions have become more effective, with improved (if imperfect) legal systems, clearer property rights, and greater respect for individual liberties. Democratic rules and norms governing the transfer of political power, free speech, and accountability have become more deeply entrenched. Civil society groups are more active.Continued progress isn\'t automatic or guaranteed. But with smart choices, it is within reach.These deep-seated changes have put enormous additional gains well within reach. If economic growth proceeds along the lines of most projections over the next two decades, some 700 million more people will escape extreme poverty. Per capita incomes in poor countries will double again, millions of childhood deaths will be avoided, tens of millions of children will get the education they deserve, hunger will decline, and basic rights and freedoms will spread further.At least, that\'s what should happen--but none of these future gains is guaranteed. Growth has slowed markedly since 2008 in emerging economies such as Brazil and China and throughout the developing world. Russia, Thailand, and Venezuela have turned less democratic, and South Africa and Turkey seem to be headed in that direction as well. The Middle East has seen the return of conflict and authoritarian rule. China\'s aggressive actions in the South China Sea could spark a major conflict that could kill tens of thousands of people and devastate the region\'s economies. Outbreaks of SARS and the H1N1 and Ebola viruses underscore humanity\'s vulnerability to disease, and many doctors worry that growing resistance to antibiotics could reverse some of the hard-fought gains in health. Meanwhile, global population is on track to exceed nine billion by 2050, and the combination of more people, higher incomes, and warmer climates will place enormous strains on the world\'s supplies of fresh water, food, and energy.Although there are ample grounds for pessimism, the doomsayers continue to underestimate humanity\'s growing ability to cooperate in the face of new challenges. In the eighteenth century, when Thomas Malthus looked at population growth and foresaw catastrophic famine, he failed to appreciate the advances in agriculture, health, and governance that human ingenuity could create. The same was true for those that predicted a population disaster in Asia in the 1960s and 1970s. Today, the problems facing developing countries are plain to see, while the new ideas and innovations that will overcome them are harder to picture. Continued progress isn\'t automatic or guaranteed. But with smart choices, it is within reach.LEADING BY EXAMPLEMost of the key choices will be made in developing countries themselves. Sustaining progress will require leaders there to reduce their countries\' dependence on natural resources, make their economies more inclusive, invest more in health and education, expand opportunities for women, and strengthen democracy and the rule of law.The future of the United States increasingly depends on growing prosperity, peace, and progress in the developing world.Yet the future of development will also depend on the actions of the world\'s leading countries, since poorer countries can prosper only in a strong global system. The United States must do its part by regaining its economic leadership through major investments in infrastructure, education, and technological advances in health, agriculture, and alternative fuels. It must act to fix its long-term budget problems by improving the solvency of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid and strengthen the financial system through better regulation. The country must also do a much better job of leading by example on democracy. Deep political polarization, the lack of substantive debate, the unwillingness to compromise, misguided foreign policy adventurism, and the Great Recession have made liberal democracy look unattractive and ineffective.That malaise matters, because many developing countries are now engaged in a battle of ideas over which economic and political model they should follow. On the one side stands the model that has prevailed in the West since World War II: market capitalism coupled with liberal democracy. On the other is the model practiced by China, Vietnam, Ethiopia, and, increasingly, Russia, among others: state capitalism coupled with authoritarian rule. And there\'s yet one more option, with a smaller but more dangerous following: religious fundamentalism, as promulgated by Iran and Saudi Arabia and groups such as the Islamic State (or ISIS) and Boko Haram in Nigeria.As the Western countries struggle and China continues to rise, authoritarian capitalism is becoming more appealing. Consider Beijing\'s ties to Africa. China purchased $26 billion in imports from the continent in 2013; the United States purchased $9 billion. Chinese investment in Africa has been growing by 50 percent per year since 2000, whereas U.S. investment is growing by 14 percent per year. Make no mistake: many Africans still prefer to follow the American model and view China with suspicion. But those attitudes are beginning to shift, and Beijing\'s apparent ability to get things done will only enhance China\'s appeal, especially if Washington seems to talk big but deliver little.THE NEXT SURGE FORWARDAside from the broader task of getting their own houses in order, the United States and other Western powers should also assert leadership in several specific areas to keep the progress going. The first is climate change, which presents one of the greatest threats to poverty reduction. Most of the world\'s poor countries had little to do with creating the problem, yet they will bear the brunt of the damage. Rising sea levels, changing rainfall patterns, higher temperatures, and dwindling water supplies will derail progress, will undermine global food production, and could engender major conflict. Developing countries have an important role to play in curbing emissions, but they will not switch to low-carbon fuels and other clean technologies if their developed-world counterparts do not. Washington has taken important first steps to reduce power-plant emissions and raise automotive fuel-efficiency standards, but there is a very long way to go.  Bruno Kelly / ReutersA man walks between solar panels which power ice machines in the Sustainable Development Reserve, in Amazonas state, Brazil, September 2015.Second, leading countries--especially the United States--should invest more in technological innovation. Much of the credit for recent improvements in living standards goes to vaccines, medicines, high-yielding seed varieties, cell phones, and the Internet. These new technologies (alongside old ones such as electricity and paved roads) have not yet reached everywhere, so simply making them more widely available would do wonders. But sustaining progress for the next several decades will also require significant investments in new vaccines, more powerful drugs, drought- and heat-resistant seeds, desalination techniques, and clean energy.Third, Western powers need to upgrade the current system of global governance. The set of institutions that emerged after World War II were innovative for their time. For all their faults, the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, and the World Health Organization contributed significantly to global peace and prosperity. But these organizations are losing legitimacy and becoming less effective, in part because developing countries feel that they are inadequately represented in them. It is time for these bodies to give developing countries more opportunities for leadership, larger voting shares, and a bigger voice in decisions.In 2014, the U.S. Congress failed to pass legislation that would have approved giving developing countries larger voting shares in the International Monetary Fund--a change with which all other member countries (and the Obama administration) had agreed. Almost immediately, China accelerated its push to establish a new development bank for Asia, and the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) followed suit by proposing a similar institution of their own. Washington then compounded its first error by trying to undermine the new institutions, reinforcing the view that it was just trying to keep developing countries in their place. The lesson was clear: when Washington fails to lead, developing countries will go their own way.Fourth, the world\'s leading countries should do more on trade. Although the United States is generally open to trade, its policies toward poor countries are strikingly protectionist: it charges high tariffs on many products from developing countries (such as textiles, shoes, and apparel) and tightly restricts the imports of a range of agricultural products (including dairy, peanuts, and sugar). Although free-trade programs, such as the African Growth and Opportunity Act, help, they are insufficient. Washington should extend duty-free and quota-free access to the world\'s poorest countries--the 48 countries designated by the UN as the least developed. It should also push to formally end the Doha Round of multilateral trade talks, which remain on life support, and open a new round of negotiations that center on the issues developing countries care about, such as food security.Finally, the United States and other leading countries should expand their foreign aid programs, both to solidify the nascent turnarounds in the surging countries and to support people in the states that remain stuck. In the past, such aid has helped lengthen life spans, increase agricultural productivity, alleviate humanitarian crises, and rebuild war-torn countries around the world. Most studies show that despite its shortcomings, aid has accelerated economic growth and helped support transitions to democracy, especially since the end of the Cold War.  But the answer is not just more money; the United States must also rethink how it provides assistance. For starters, aid agencies should develop innovative ways to encourage private investment. They can encourage local banks to provide loans to promising entrepreneurs, as does the Development Credit Authority, a small program within the U.S. Agency for International Development that should be expanded significantly. They can encourage investment in developing countries by working with local suppliers to improve the quality of the goods and services they sell or by financing private investors\' due diligence and environmental impact assessments.At the same time, aid agencies should invest more in disseminating new technologies, working closely with universities, foundations, private companies, and local entrepreneurs. Doing so will require new types of relationships, incentive structures, and knowledge sharing, along with a greater willingness to take risks. Aid agencies should also invest far more in programs to support girls and women, since mountains of evidence show that doing so dramatically improves the health, education, and economic opportunities of poor families. Above all, they should provide much more funding to the poorest countries, and especially democracies, since progress on development in these countries will have the knock-on effect of improving governance. The Obama administration has taken important steps on this front, building on the Bush administration\'s health programs and unveiling new initiatives on food security and electricity, but the next administration should scale up these programs to meet new challenges.The future of the United States increasingly depends on growing prosperity, peace, and progress in the developing world. The last two decades have given humanity a tremendous start in what ultimately may rank as one of the greatest transformations in world history. Today, the United States has a rare opportunity to stand with the people and leaders of developing countries to ensure that this progress continues for decades to come. '

S'Almost five years ago, mass protests swept the Egyptian autocrat Hosni Mubarak from power. Most local and foreign observers believed that Egypt was on the path to a democratic future; some even proclaimed that democracy had arrived. But the election of Mohamed Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood\'s Freedom and Justice Party led to polarization and violence, and in 2013, after more mass protests, General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi seized power in a military coup. Since then, Sisi\'s regime has killed more than 1,000 civilians, imprisoned tens of thousands more, and cracked down on media and civil society.Nearby Tunisia has fared better. The wave of Arab uprisings began there in 2010, and the democratic government that Tunisia\'s revolution ushered in has survived. It succeeded at one of a transition\'s critical tasks: agreeing on a new constitution, an achievement recognized by the Nobel Committee when it awarded its Peace Prize to a quartet of civil society organizations active in Tunisia\'s transition. But Tunisia\'s democracy remains fragile, threatened by political violence, a crackdown on dissidents, and human rights violations. In Cuba, too, there are finally hopes for a democratic future, as aging authoritarian rulers begin to introduce reforms. And in Myanmar (also known as Burma), a slow and uneven transition from military rule to inclusive governance may be under way, but it remains fraught with difficulties.  Mohamed Abd El Ghany / REUTERSA poster of deposed Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi amid the debris of a cleared protest camp in Cairo, August 2013.What determines whether attempts at democratic transitions will be successful? Past experience offers some insights. We conducted extended interviews with 12 former presidents and one former prime minister who played vital roles in the successful democratic transitions of Brazil, Chile, Ghana, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, South Africa, and Spain. Some were leaders in authoritarian regimes who nevertheless helped steer their countries toward effective democracy. F. W. de Klerk, as president of South Africa, negotiated with Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress (ANC) to bring an end to apartheid. B. J. Habibie, vice president under Indonesia\'s long-ruling dictator, Suharto, became president after Suharto\'s resignation in the face of massive protests. Habibie then freed political prisoners, legalized trade unions, ended press censorship, allowed the formation of new political parties, and transformed the rules of Indonesian politics, paving the way to constitutional democracy.Other leaders were prominent in opposition movements that brought an end to authoritarian rule and subsequently helped build stable democracies. Patricio Aylwin, a leader of the opposition to General Augusto Pinochet, Chile\'s long-ruling dictator, became his country\'s first elected president after the restoration of democracy in 1990. Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a Catholic intellectual and a leader of the trade union Solidarity, became the first prime minister of postcommunist Poland.We also interviewed bridge figures: leaders who straddled autocracy and democracy, such as Aleksander Kwasniewski, a cabinet minister in Poland\'s communist government who was involved in the Round Table discussions that led to Poland\'s democratic opening. Later, as president, he helped build Poland\'s democratic institutions. Fidel Ramos, a high-ranking military official in the Philippines under the autocratic regime of Ferdinand Marcos, joined the opposition during the massive People Power demonstrations in 1986. He later served as defense minister and then as the second president of the post-Marcos democracy.Although broader social, civil, and political forces played important roles, these leaders were key to their countries\' successful transitions. They helped bring authoritarian regimes to an end and built constitutional democracies in their place, institutionalized through regular, reasonably fair elections, combined with meaningful restraints on executive power and practical guarantees of essential political rights--and none of these transformations has been reversed. Democracy remains a work in progress in some of these countries, but the transitions fundamentally changed the distribution of power and the practice of politics.Of course, there is no one-size-fits-all model for democratic change. Yet past transitions do offer some broadly applicable lessons. Democratic reformers must be ready to compromise as they prioritize incremental progress over comprehensive solutions. They must build coalitions, reach out to some within the regimes they seek to overthrow, and grapple with questions of justice and retribution. And they must bring the military under civilian control. Those interested in building democracies from the ruins of dictatorships can improve their odds by following these best practices.PREPARING THE GROUNDA successful democratic transition begins long before elected politicians take office. The opposition must first gain enough public support to challenge the regime\'s capacity to govern and position itself as a plausible contender for power. Opposition leaders have to mobilize protests; denounce the imprisonment, torture, and expulsion of dissidents; and erode the regime\'s national and international legitimacy.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display("dfp-ad-x90_2");    });  This often requires bridging deep disagreements among the opposition about aims, leadership, strategies, and tactics. Most of the transition leaders we interviewed worked assiduously over time to overcome such divisions and build broad coalitions of opposition forces, uniting political parties, social movements, workers, students, religious institutions, and key business interests around a common agenda. In Poland, the trade union Solidarity worked closely with student organizations, intellectuals, and elements of the Catholic Church. Brazil\'s opposition movement convinced industrialists in Sao Paulo to back its cause. In Spain, opposition groups resolved many of their differences in the negotiations leading up to the Moncloa Pacts of 1977, where they agreed on how to run the economy during the transition.Uniting the opposition is not enough; democratic forces must also exploit divisions within the regime.By contrast, wherever the opposition fails to unite, the prospects for democracy suffer. In Venezuela, serious divisions over how confrontational to be toward the government have thus far prevented the opposition from taking full advantage of the regime\'s economic mismanagement. In Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic was able to rule in an increasingly authoritarian manner after taking power in 1989 thanks in part to the inability of the Serbian opposition to present a unified front. In Ukraine, the Orange Revolution of 2004-5 overturned an election result widely considered to have been rigged. But divisions among reformers then held back the further development of democratic institutions and the rule of law, leading to another decade of oligarchic rule and political corruption.Democratic opposition movements also need to build bridges with those who cooperated in the past with the regime but who may now be ready to support democratization. Focusing on past grievances tends to be counterproductive, so democratic reformers should instead consistently project a positive and forward-looking vision of the transition to counter the pervasive fear that authoritarian regimes instill. At the same time, they should marginalize those who refuse to renounce violence or who insist on uncompromising demands for regional, ethnic, or sectarian autonomy.But uniting the opposition is not enough; democratic forces must also understand and exploit divisions within the incumbent regime. To persuade elements within the regime to be open to change, reformers must make credible assurances that they will not seek revenge or confiscate the assets of regime insiders. Opposition movements should work hard to become viable interlocutors for those within the authoritarian regime who desire an exit strategy, while isolating those who remain intransigent. For example, the Brazilian reformer Fernando Henrique Cardoso\'s core strategy was to induce elements of the military to reach out in search of an exit.Incumbents who recognize the need to turn away from authoritarian rule, in turn, must find ways to maintain the support of their core constituencies while negotiating with opposition groups. The "bush retreats" de Klerk held with members of his cabinet in 1989 and 1990 are a model for this. At these talks, he built a secret consensus within his cabinet for the dramatic steps he would announce: legalizing the ANC, freeing Mandela and other political prisoners, and opening formal negotiations.  Juda Ngwenya / REUTERSNelson Mandela and F. W. de Klerk in Pretoria, May 1994.Direct contact between the opposition and the regime can take place secretly at first, if necessary, as was the case with the initial contacts between government officials and ANC representatives, which were held outside South Africa in the mid-1980s. Informal dialogues, such as the Round Table discussions in Poland, can help members of the regime and the democratic opposition understand each other, overcome stereotypes, and build working relationships. As de Klerk observed, "You cannot resolve a conflict without the parties involved talking to each other. . . . In order to succeed with negotiations, you have to put yourself in the other party\'s shoes. One must think through their case and determine . . . [the other party\'s] minimum requirements in order to ensure their cooperative, constructive participation in the negotiation process."Throughout this process, reformers must exert pressure on the regime and take risks to achieve continuous progress, even if it is only gradual and incremental. They must be prepared to make compromises, even if these leave some vital aims only partially achieved and some important supporters frustrated. Dismissing maximalist positions often calls for more political courage than hewing to attractive but impractical principles. Transition-making is not a task for the dogmatic.In Ghana, for instance, John Kufuor, the leader of the New Patriotic Party, rejected his party\'s boycott of the 1992 election, arguing that the party should participate in the 1996 election, even though it might lose. Kufuor\'s subsequent victory in the 2000 election led to a peaceful transfer of power through the ballot box, a pattern that has continued for 15 years. And in Mexico, Ernesto Zedillo, although a prominent member of the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), supported incremental reforms in electoral procedures negotiated with the opposition at a time when the PRI seemed unlikely, after seven decades in power, ever to cede control. Later, as president, he agreed to further changes regarding campaign finance and supported a reform to strengthen the electoral authorities that helped open the way, in 2000, for the unprecedented transfer of power from the PRI to the opposition.  REUTERSUkrainians at a polling station in Kiev, March 2006.The dangers that lie in a refusal to compromise were clear in the case of Egypt. During the Muslim Brotherhood\'s brief reign, the group insisted on an Islamist agenda as it drafted a new constitution, and this alienated large swaths of the population. In Chile, extreme leftist members of the opposition espoused "all forms of struggle," including violence, against the Pinochet regime. By 1986, a majority of the opposition movement understood that they could not unseat the dictatorship by force and that association with the extreme left tarnished the opposition. They turned instead to peaceful contestation and pledged to build a "homeland for all." This approach helped the opposition triumph over Augusto Pinochet in the 1988 plebiscite, an election that many in the opposition had initially wanted to boycott.CIVILIANS AND SECURITYToppling an authoritarian regime is one thing; governing is quite another. Transition leaders often face pressure to clean house entirely and start anew, but they should resist: governing requires perspectives, personnel, and skills that are quite different from those needed for opposition. Once the opposition takes power, the most important step is to end violence and restore order while ensuring that all security forces act within the law. Our interviews provided fascinating accounts of the protracted challenges that civil-military relations pose. Reformers have to bring all the security services under democratic civilian control as soon as possible, at the same time as recognizing and respecting the legitimate roles of these services, providing them with sufficient resources, and protecting their leaders from sweeping reprisals for past repression.Subjecting the security services to civilian control is one of the most protracted challenges new democracies face.To accomplish this, the police and the domestic intelligence services should be separated from the armed forces. Leaders should inculcate new attitudes among the police toward the general population by emphasizing the responsibility of the security forces to protect civilians rather than repress them, without reducing the forces\' capacity to dismantle violent groups. Reformers should remove top officers responsible for torture and brutal repression, place senior military commanders under the direct authority of civilian ministers of defense, and insist that active-duty military officers refrain entirely from political involvement.Such steps are easier to prescribe than to enact, and implementing them requires keen political judgment and courage. In some circumstances, they can be addressed early on; in others, they will take considerable time. But they should receive high priority from the start, as well as sustained vigilance. As Habibie explained, discussing civil-military relations in Indonesia, "Those who lead a transition . . . have to show, not by talking or writing, but by action, the importance of civilian control."Senior civilian officials charged with overseeing security forces should be knowledgeable about security matters and respectful of their peers in the military, the police, and the intelligence services. This can be difficult where democratic movements have clashed violently with the security services, where mutual distrust persists, and where there is little respect for civilian expertise in military affairs.  STRINGER / REUTERSGhana\'s President John Kufuor votes in Accra, 2008.Transition leaders also have to balance the desire to hold the previous regime accountable with the need to preserve the discipline and morale of the security forces. They have to foster peaceful mutual acceptance among formerly bitter enemies--no easy matter. Only then will citizens begin to trust a state that many understandably have rejected as illegitimate and hostile, and only then will security forces cooperate fully with citizens they have previously regarded as subversive.Subjecting the security services to civilian control is one of the most protracted challenges new democracies face. The continued supremacy that the Egyptian military enjoys over any elected institution lies at the heart of Egypt\'s failed democratic transition. And in countries as diverse as Gambia, Myanmar, and Thailand, the absence of civilian authority over the security forces remains the most important obstacle to a successful democratic transition.THE CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGEBringing the military under civilian control can help transition leaders inspire domestic trust and international legitimacy. So, too, can the development of electoral procedures that reflect the will of the majority and that reassure those who lose elections that their core concerns will be respected under the rule of law. In most countries, drafting a new constitution is essential, although Indonesia retained its 1945 constitution with some altered provisions and Poland did not adopt a full new constitution until several years after the end of communism.A wide range of participants should be involved in drafting a constitution that addresses the central concerns of key sectors, even when this means accepting, at least temporarily, procedures that restrict democracy. Consider the biased electoral systems maintained in Chile for 25 years after the end of the Pinochet regime to placate the military and conservative groups and the granting of the post of deputy president to the opposition leader in South Africa. Building broad support for a new constitution may also require incorporating lofty aspirations that need to be scaled back later or else implemented gradually, such as the ambitious socioeconomic provisions of Brazil\'s 1988 constitution, which called for expansive labor rights, agrarian reform, and universal health care.Reformers must make compromises, even if these leave some vital aims only partially achieved.Although the exact wording of a constitution matters, it may matter more how, when, and by whom the constitution is adopted. Its framers must achieve broad buy-in and make sure that it is neither too easy nor practically impossible to amend the constitution when conditions warrant. Many criticized Aylwin\'s formulation that the truth commission in Chile could provide justice only "as far as possible"--but what was possible expanded over the years. The key aim should be to establish broad acceptance of the basic rules of democratic engagement. As Thabo Mbeki, South Africa\'s second postapartheid president, observed, "It was important that the constitution be owned by the people of South Africa as a whole and therefore that the process of drawing up the constitution be inclusive."The process must include supporters of the former regime, who will need assurances that their rights will be respected under the rule of law. The wholesale prosecution of former officials is unwise. The new leaders should instead establish transparent legal processes to seek the truth about past abuses, provide recognition and perhaps reparation to victims, and, when feasible, bring major culprits to justice. Although full reconciliation may be impossible, mutual tolerance is an essential goal. Compromises, once again, are vital.BALANCING ACTSAs democratic transitions take hold, the public often blames democratic leaders--and sometimes democracy itself--for failing to meet economic or political expectations. The new authorities typically inherit deep-rooted patterns of corruption and inefficiency. Movements that united in opposing the authoritarian regime may fragment. Civil society organizations that contributed to anti-authoritarian opposition movements sometimes decay or adopt disruptive positions, especially after many of their most talented leaders enter government or party politics.Building constructive relations between a new government and a new opposition is an ongoing challenge. Competition between a government and its opposition is healthy for democracy, but complete obstruction by the opposition or the suppression of all criticism by the government can quickly destroy it. An independent judiciary that holds the executive accountable without blocking too many new initiatives and free and responsible media can help entrench a sustainable democracy.Political parties also play an important role, so long as they do not become merely the vehicles of particular individuals and their cronies. Well-organized and programmatic democratic parties provide the best way to engage people of all classes, mobilize effective pressure, organize sustainable support for policies, channel public demands, and identify and promote skilled leaders. The development of strong parties requires careful attention to procedures and safeguards regarding candidate selection, campaign finance, and access to the media. Continuing challenges to democratic governance in Ghana, Indonesia, and the Philippines are due in part to weak political parties.Although transitions are usually triggered by political, rather than economic, causes, economic challenges soon become a priority for new governments. Reducing poverty and unemployment may conflict with the economic reforms needed to promote long-term growth and macroeconomic stability. Before strong popular support erodes, the government should implement social measures that mitigate the hardships endured by the most vulnerable, but it also needs to exercise fiscal responsibility. The leaders of all the transitions we studied adopted market-oriented approaches and prudent macroeconomic monetary and fiscal policies, but most did so cautiously to avoid fueling popular fears that public interests were being sold out to the privileged. Even those who were initially hostile to free markets accepted that markets were necessary in an increasingly globalized economy, alongside strong social policies that could produce more equitable economic development.As the recent history of Western interventions in the Middle East amply demonstrates, democracy is not an export commodity. But external actors, governmental and nongovernmental, can effectively support democratic transitions if they respect local forces and become involved at their invitation. Sometimes, they can provide the conditions necessary for quiet dialogue among opposition leaders and between the opposition and representatives of the regime. They can offer advice on many practical issues, from how to conduct a campaign to how to make effective use of the media, and eventually how to monitor elections. Economic sanctions can help curb repression, as they did in Poland and South Africa. And foreign countries can offer aid and investment to support democratic transitions, as they did in Ghana, the Philippines, and Poland. International economic assistance during a transition can provide room for political reform when delivered in response to local priorities and in cooperation with local actors.International intervention cannot take the place of domestic initiatives, however. External actors are most likely to be effective when they listen, raise questions that arise from their experience of similar challenges, and encourage local participants to consider issues from various perspectives.A CHANGING WORLDNew actors, technologies, economic pressures, and geopolitical dynamics have transformed the context in which today\'s democratic transitions will take place. Anyone with a mobile phone can now spark mass protests by recording police violence. Social media can rapidly reshape public opinion and allow organizers to assemble large numbers of followers. But these new technologies cannot substitute for the hard work of building institutions. As Cardoso, the Brazilian reformer turned president, observed, "The problem is that it is easy to mobilize to destroy but much more difficult to rebuild. The new technologies are not sufficient by themselves to take the next step forward. Institutions are needed, along with the capacity to understand, process, and exercise leadership that is sustained over time." As Kufuor put it: "The masses cannot construct institutions. That\'s why leadership is important."  In the years ahead, social movements and civil society organizations, enhanced by digital networking, will perhaps pressure autocratic regimes more often and more effectively than in the past. Yet these movements cannot replace political parties and leaders. It is these actors that must ultimately build institutions, construct electoral and governing coalitions, win public support, prepare and implement policies, elicit sacrifices for the common good, inspire people to believe that democracy is possible, and govern effectively.It is hard to build functioning and sustainable democracies in countries where there is no recent experience of self-government, where social and civic organizations are fragile, and where weak state institutions are incapable of providing adequate services and security. Democracy may also be difficult to establish in countries with strong ethnic, sectarian, or regional divisions. And democratically elected governments can nonetheless rule autocratically by ignoring, weakening, or paying mere lip service to the legislative and judicial restraints that democratic governance requires. Yet it is precisely all these countries that need democratic change most urgently. The examples of Ghana, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Africa, and Spain show that these challenges can be met under many different conditions, even in profoundly divided countries.More educated young people than ever can be mobilized today to demonstrate in public squares for democracy, especially where employment is scarce. The challenge, however, is to engage them on an ongoing basis in constructing durable political parties and other institutions. Democracy does not emerge directly or inevitably from crowds in the street. Building democracies requires vision, negotiation and compromise, hard work, persistence, skill, leadership--and some luck. Despite all the obstacles, however, democratic transitions have succeeded in the past. Learning and applying the lessons of these successful experiences can help end autocracies and forge sustainable democracies in their place. '

S'The debate over how the United States should respond to the rise of China is usually based on the premise that a power transition is taking place. But Christensen characterizes this idea as at least premature and probably flat wrong. He draws from his academic research and policy experience as a deputy assistant secretary of state under President George W. Bush to present an exceptionally clear and subtle analysis of the evolving U.S.-Chinese relationship. Although China is "nowhere near a peer competitor," its "reactive assertiveness" presents a real risk of conflict, which has to be countered by a strong U.S. presence in Asia. This presence, however, must be balanced by assurances, expressed more in actions than in words, that the United States does not threaten Chinese security. Christensen gives examples from recent administrations of some moves that succeeded in walking this fine line and others that failed. He argues that an even more difficult challenge is to get China to bear its share of the costs in managing global problems such as climate change and nuclear proliferation. Beijing is likely to cooperate on such issues not in response to moral preaching but when it sees direct benefits from doing so. Washington should not panic about the rise of China, but it needs a steady and nuanced strategy to shape Chinese behavior. blank'

S'Two main camps dominate scholarship on the origins of capitalism. Internalists argue that capitalism was born European, or more specifically British, and then became global. A system of interconnected parts and peoples, it radiated out from a few original hot spots and over time replaced the "isms" it encountered elsewhere. The internalist narrative has long been shadowed by an externalist rival, which sees Europe\'s leap forward as dependent on relations with places beyond Europe. The most recent externalist explanation of capitalism is Beckert\'s Empire of Cotton. Beckert, a leading global historian, offers a dark story of capitalism, born of worldwide empire and violence. The book is a triple threat: it insists that the Industrial Revolution would never have happened without external trade, that the rise of industrialism and factory labor would never have transpired without the spread of slave labor, and that cotton was a commodity that made an empire and thus the world economy. In other words, capitalism was born global because it required an empire to buoy it.Read the full review. blank'

S"Western governments and many prominent Western academics buy the idea that the best way to influence China's human rights policies is through informal diplomatic discussions about individual cases and Chinese laws rather than through public means, such as sanctions and UN resolutions. Kinzelbach exposes this as a myth. Employing remarkable interviews and archival and historical research, she builds a convincing case that this quiet approach is not only useless but also counterproductive. She shows how the Chinese cleverly employ closed-door sessions with the EU not only to deflect Western criticism but also to train rising officials in how to counter it in public. Kinzelbach faults the EU's decentralized structure and its analysts' naivete for Europeans' misplaced faith in private dialogue. But this seems insufficiently cynical: she assumes that eu states actually want to prioritize an effective human rights policy toward China and are willing to pay a price for it. But perhaps they simply seek to deflect their own domestic political pressure to play tough with China. Still, this is not just the best study of Western human rights policy toward China and of informal human rights dialogue in print; it is also one of the best microanalyses of a sensitive contemporary policy issue that I have ever read. blank"

S'The EU used to be a polity without politics, because none of the issues it handled were salient to most European voters. That changed forever when the union undertook an ill-advised intervention in monetary policy by creating the euro and then sticking with it through the financial crisis. Those decisions have had disastrous consequences for public trust in and support for the EU, which have plummeted in the years since. Most subsequent commentary has focused on the technocratic details of eu monetary policy and banking regulation. Cramme and Hobolt bring together some leading academic minds to puzzle through deeper questions. Is the EU politically sustainable? If so, in what form? What are the implications of the euro for democratic participation? In general, the contributors are skeptical that the EU will be able to put itself back together again in anything like its previous form, but they remain equally skeptical of radical reform.

S'At a time when Russian relations with the United States and western European countries are growing cold, the relatively warm ties between China and Russia have attracted renewed interest. Scholars and journalists in the West find themselves debating the nature of the Chinese-Russian partnership and wondering whether it will evolve into an alliance.Since the end of the Cold War, two main views have tended to define Western assessments of the Chinese-Russian relationship and predictions of its future. The first view holds that the link between Beijing and Moscow is vulnerable, contingent, and marked by uncertainties--a "marriage of convenience," to use the phrase favored by many advocates of this argument, who see it as unlikely that the two countries will grow much closer and quite possible that they will begin to drift apart. The other view posits that strategic and even ideological factors form the basis of Chinese-Russian ties and predicts that the two countries--both of which see the United States as a possible obstacle to their objectives--will eventually form an anti-U.S., anti-Western alliance.Neither view accurately captures the true nature of the relationship. The Chinese-Russian relationship is a stable strategic partnership and by no means a marriage of convenience: it is complex, sturdy, and deeply rooted. Changes in international relations since the end of the Cold War have only brought the two countries closer together. Some Western analysts and officials have speculated (and perhaps even hoped) that the ongoing conflicts in Syria and Ukraine, in which Russia has become heavily involved, would lead to tensions between Beijing and Moscow--or even a rupture. But that has not happened.Nevertheless, China has no interest in a formal alliance with Russia, nor in forming an anti-U.S. or anti-Western bloc of any kind. Rather, Beijing hopes that China and Russia can maintain their relationship in a way that will provide a safe environment for the two big neighbors to achieve their development goals and to support each other through mutually beneficial cooperation, offering a model for how major countries can manage their differences and cooperate in ways that strengthen the international system.TIES THAT BINDOn several occasions between the end of the nineteenth century and the middle of the twentieth century, China entered into an alliance with the Russian empire and its successor, the Soviet Union. But every time, the arrangement proved short-lived, as each amounted to nothing more than an expediency between countries of unequal strength. In the decades that followed, the two powerful communist-led countries muddled through, occasionally cooperating but often riven by rivalry and mistrust. In 1989, in the waning years of Soviet rule, they finally restored normalcy to their relations. They jointly declared that they would develop bilateral relations based on "mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual nonaggression, noninterference in each other\'s internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence." Two years later, the Soviet Union disintegrated, but Chinese-Russian relations carried on with the principle of "no alliance, no conflict, and no targeting any third country."Soon thereafter, the newborn Russian Federation embraced the so-called Atlanticist approach. To win the trust and help of the West, Russia not only followed Western prescriptions for economic reform but also made concessions on major security issues, including reducing its stockpile of strategic nuclear weapons. However, things didn\'t turn out the way the Russians had hoped, as the country\'s economy tanked and its regional influence waned. In 1992, disappointed with what they saw as unfulfilled pledges of American and European assistance and irritated by talk of NATO\'s eastward expansion, the Russians began to pay more attention to Asia. That year, China and Russia announced that each would regard the other as a "friendly country" and issued a joint political statement stipulating that "the freedom of people to choose their own development paths should be respected, while differences in social systems and ideologies should not hamper the normal progress of relations."The Chinese-Russian relationship represents a possible model for other states to follow.Ever since, Chinese-Russian relations have gradually improved and deepened. During the past 20 years or so, bilateral trade and investment have expanded on a massive scale. In 2011, China became Russia\'s largest trading partner. In 2014 alone, China\'s investment in Russia grew by 80 percent--and the trend toward more investment remains strong. To get a sense of the growth in economic ties, consider that in the early 1990s, annual bilateral trade between China and Russia amounted to around $5 billion; by 2014, it came close to $100 billion. That year, Beijing and Moscow signed a landmark agreement to construct a pipeline that, by 2018, will bring as much as 38 billion cubic meters of Russian natural gas to China every year. The two countries are also planning significant deals involving nuclear power generation, aerospace manufacturing, high-speed rail, and infrastructure development. Furthermore, they are cooperating on new multinational financial institutions, such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the New Development Bank BRICS, and the BRICS foreign exchange reserve pool.Meanwhile, security ties have improved as well. China has become one of the largest importers of Russian arms, and the two countries are discussing a number of joint arms research-and-development projects. Extensive Chinese-Russian defense cooperation involves consultations between high-level military personnel and joint training and exercises, including more than a dozen joint counterterrorism exercises during the past decade or so, carried out either bilaterally or under the auspices of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. In the past 20 years, thousands of Chinese military personnel have studied in Russia, and many Russian military officials have received short-term training at the National Defense University of China.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display("dfp-ad-x90_2");    });  As economic and military links have strengthened, so, too, have political ones. In 2008, China and Russia were able to peacefully resolve territorial disputes that had troubled relations for decades, formally demarcating their 2,600-mile-plus border and thus eliminating their single largest source of tension--a rare achievement for big neighbors. In recent years, the two countries have held regular annual meetings between their heads of states, prime ministers, top legislators, and foreign ministers. Since 2013, when Xi Jinping became president of China, he has paid five visits to Russia, and Russian President Vladimir Putin has traveled three times to China in the same time period. All told, Xi and Putin have met 12 times, making Putin the foreign head of state whom Xi has met most frequently since assuming the presidency.  Carlos Barria / ReutersRussia\'s President Vladimir Putin and China\'s President Xi Jinping at a welcoming ceremony, Shanghai, May 2014.MANAGING DIFFERENCESFor all this progress, differences still exist between the two neighbors, and they don\'t always share the same focus when it comes to foreign policy. Russia is traditionally oriented toward Europe, whereas China is more concerned with Asia. The two countries\' diplomatic styles differ as well. Russia is more experienced on the global theater, and it tends to favor strong, active, and often surprising diplomatic maneuvers. Chinese diplomacy, in contrast, is more reactive and cautious.China\'s rise has produced discomfort among some in Russia, where some people have had difficulty adjusting to the shift in relative power between China and Russia. There is still talk in Russia of "the China threat," a holdover expression from past eras. A poll conducted in 2008 by Russia\'s Public Opinion Foundation showed that around 60 percent of Russians were concerned that Chinese migration to Far Eastern border areas would threaten Russia\'s territorial integrity; 41 percent believed that a stronger China would harm Russian interests. And as China\'s quest for new investment and trade opportunities abroad has led to increased Chinese cooperation with former Soviet states, Russians have worried that China is competing for influence in their neighborhood. Partly as a result, Moscow initially hesitated to support Beijing\'s Silk Road Economic Belt initiative before ultimately embracing it in 2014. Meanwhile, some Chinese continue to nurse historical grievances regarding Russia. Despite the resolution of the border issue, Chinese commentators sometimes make critical references to the nearly 600,000 square miles of Chinese territory that tsarist Russia annexed in the late nineteenth century.However, these differences hardly support speculation in the West that Beijing and Moscow are drifting apart. This theory has occasionally appeared in Western commentary in the past two years, as Russia\'s relations with the United States and the EU have deteriorated owing to the crises in Syria and Ukraine. Despite some differences, however, China and Russia share a desire to firmly develop their bilateral relations and understand that they must join hands to achieve national security and development. Their cooperation is conducive to balance in the international system and can facilitate the solution of some international problems. Sometimes they agree; sometimes they do not. But they are able to acknowledge and manage their disagreements while continuing to expand areas of consensus. As Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has noted, the Chinese-Russian relationship offers a new approach for conducting external relations and represents a possible model for other states to follow.The Chinese-Russian relationship is a stable strategic partnership: it is complex, sturdy, and deeply rooted.The crises in Syria and Ukraine illuminate the ways in which China and Russia have effectively managed their partnership. Many in the United States see China\'s attitude toward the conflict in Ukraine as unclear or suspect that China has sided with Russia. In fact, after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, the spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated unequivocally that Ukraine\'s independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity should be respected. China emphasized that all the parties involved in the Ukrainian conflict should resolve their differences through dialogue, establish coordinating mechanisms, refrain from activities that could worsen the situation, and assist Ukraine in maintaining its economic and financial stability. China did not take any side: fairness and objectivity serve as guiding principles for Beijing when addressing international affairs.But Chinese diplomats and leaders are also mindful of what led to the crisis, including the series of Western-supported "color revolutions" in post-Soviet states and the pressure on Russia that resulted from NATO\'s eastward expansion. It is also worth noting that there have long been complicated historical, ethnic, religious, and territorial issues between Russia and the former Soviet republics. The Ukraine crisis is a result of all these factors. As Xi put it, the crisis is "not coming from nowhere."On Syria, the view in Beijing is that Russia launched its military intervention at the request of the Syrian government in order to combat terrorist and extremist forces. Although Washington has called for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down, it shares Russia\'s goal of taking on the Islamic State (also known as ISIS). So on the one hand, the United States has criticized the Russian intervention, but on the other hand, it has expressed willingness to work with Russia on counterterrorism. The Russian move, then, was not exactly what the United States wanted to see but was not an entirely bad thing for U.S. interests, either. From China\'s perspective, Russia and the United States share an interest in confronting the brutal terrorists of ISIS. The hope in China is that talks among Russia, the United States, Iran, and a number of other regional powers will make progress in resolving the conflict.But it is difficult to know how far U.S.-Russian cooperation in Syria can go without a common understanding about what will lead to peace and order. And many in China find it perplexing that U.S. and Russian perceptions are still so heavily influenced by the Cold War. U.S. politicians and commentators tend to talk about Russia as if it were still the failed Cold War rival. Meanwhile, Russian officials and observers frequently criticize Washington\'s behavior as arrogant or imperial. Some analysts on both sides have suggested that the standoff between Moscow and Washington over Syria and Ukraine could lead to a new Cold War. But from China\'s point of view, the current confrontations seem more like a prolonged ending of the original Cold War. It remains unclear if Moscow and Washington will take this opportunity to finally put old enmities to rest.  Kim Kyung-Hoon / ReutersU.S. President Barack Obama, China\'s President Xi Jinping, and Russia\'s President Vladimir Putin in Beijing, November 2014.GETTING PAST ZERO-SUMGiven the way that relations among China, Russia, and the United States are intertwined, no analysis of Chinese-Russian ties would be complete without a consideration of where things stand between China and the United States. Compared with the Chinese-Russian relationship, the one between Beijing and Washington is wider and more complicated. Combined, China and the United States account for one-third of global GDP. In 2014, U.S.-Chinese trade reached nearly $600 billion, and accumulated mutual investment exceeded $120 billion. Thirty-seven years ago, when the People\'s Republic of China established diplomatic relations with the United States, no one expected such a strong partnership to emerge.But there is no denying the structural difficulties in the relationship. Significant differences remain between Chinese and U.S. political values and between the governing systems in the two countries. And many Americans perceive China\'s growing economic strength and its correspondingly higher international influence as a potential threat to Washington\'s global leadership. China has quickly grown into the world\'s second-largest economy. When U.S. troops invaded Iraq in 2003, China\'s GDP was roughly one-eighth that of the United States. By the time the Americans pulled out of Iraq eight years later, China\'s GDP had grown to half that of the United States. According to many estimates, China\'s GDP will approach the United States\' by 2020. These changes have provoked fears in Washington that China and the United States are on a collision course. Disputes over China\'s construction activities in the Spratly Islands, in the South China Sea, have fueled a heated debate about how the United States should respond to what some American scholars and commentators see as expansionism. Meanwhile, Beijing regards the presence of U.S. military vessels near Chinese territory in the South China Sea as an act of provocation. Some argue that U.S. policy toward China may shift from constructive engagement to containment.  US Navy/CPO John Hageman/ReutersThe US Navy guided-missile destroyer USS Lassen in the Pacific Ocean, November 2009.These debates provided the backdrop for Xi\'s state visit to Washington last September. In remarks during the visit, Xi directly addressed the idea that China\'s development presents a challenge to the United States\' global leadership. "The path China follows is one of peaceful development, and China does not pose a threat to other countries," Xi said. Later, he added, "People should give up the old concepts of \'you lose, I win,\' or zero-sum game, and establish a new concept of peaceful development and win-win cooperation. If China develops well, it will benefit the whole world and benefit the United States. If the United States develops well, it will also benefit the world and China."Significant differences remain between Chinese and U.S. political values and between the governing systems in the two countries.Chinese leaders attribute much of their country\'s rapid ascent to China\'s successful integration into the world economy. They see China as a beneficiary of the international order, with the UN at its core, and as a strong advocate of principles such as sovereign equality and nonintervention in the internal affairs of states, which the UN Charter enshrines. China expects that it will have to focus on its own domestic economic and social development for a long time to come and thus highly values the maintenance of a stable and peaceful external environment. Although China is determined to protect its own interests and would respond firmly to provocations, encroachments on its territorial sovereignty, or threats to its rights and interests, its main goal is still to ensure that peace and stability prevail. And China is committed to safeguarding the international order and the Asia-Pacific regional order, as well as further integrating into the globalized world.Improving U.S.-Chinese relations represents an important part of China\'s diplomatic effort. Last September marked Xi\'s first state visit to Washington, but he and U.S. President Barack Obama had previously met five times since 2013 and had spoken over the phone on three occasions. In June 2013, when the two leaders met at the Sunnylands summit, in California, they talked for more than seven hours. After the meeting, Xi announced that China and the United States would pursue a "new model of major-country relationship," which he defined as a relationship based on nonconflict, nonconfrontation, mutual respect, and win-win cooperation. The two leaders have since continued their conversations on that theme: in November 2014 in Beijing, they held the "Yingtai dialogue," which lasted for nearly five hours. And during Xi\'s state visit, he and Obama spent around nine hours talking to each other and attending events together. These long meetings between the two leaders have helped them build understanding and ward off the confrontation that some U.S. analysts believe is inevitable.The state visit, in particular, was very productive. The two sides reached agreement on a wide range of issues, including macroeconomic policy coordination, climate change, global health, counterterrorism, and nuclear nonproliferation. Xi and Obama also spoke candidly about the cybersecurity issues that have represented a serious point of contention between Beijing and Washington; the two leaders clarified their countries\' intentions, agreed to form a high-level joint dialogue on the subject, and committed to work together to establish an international cybersecurity code of conduct. This is a strong demonstration that the two countries can promote global cooperation on important issues.Of course, Beijing and Washington may continue to have disagreements over the South China Sea, Taiwan, human rights, trade policy, and other matters. The intentions of the U.S. military alliances in the Asia-Pacific remain a particular source of concern for China, especially since Washington announced its "pivot" to Asia in 2011. Some U.S. allies in the region have made claims on China\'s sovereign territory and infringed on Chinese maritime rights, hoping that by cozying up to Washington, they could involve the United States in their disputes with Beijing. This is a dangerous path, reminiscent of the "bloc politics" of the Cold War.Some scholars in China and elsewhere have suggested that if the United States insists on imposing bloc politics on the region, China and Russia should consider responding by forming a bloc of their own. But the Chinese leadership does not approve of such arguments. China does not pursue blocs or alliances, nor do such arrangements fit comfortably with Chinese political culture. Russia does not intend to form such an bloc, either. China and Russia should stick to the principle of partnership rather than build an alliance. As for China and the United States, they should continue pursuing a new model of major-country relations and allow dialogue, cooperation, and management of differences to prevail.THREE SIDES TO EVERY STORY  Relations among China, Russia, and the United States currently resemble a scalene triangle, in which the greatest distance between the three points lies between Moscow and Washington. Within this triangle, Chinese-Russian relations are the most positive and stable. The U.S.-Chinese relationship has frequent ups and downs, and U.S.-Russian relations have become very tense, especially because Russia now has to contend with significant U.S. sanctions. Meanwhile, both Beijing and Moscow object to Washington\'s use of force against and imposition of sanctions on other countries and to the double standards the United States applies in its foreign policies.The United States and its allies might interpret closer ties between China and Russia as evidence of a proto-alliance that intends to disrupt or challenge the U.S.-led world order. But from the Chinese perspective, the tripartite relationship should not be considered a game in which two players ally against a third. The sound development of Chinese-Russian relations is not intended to harm the United States, nor should Washington seek to influence it. Likewise, China\'s cooperation with the United States will not be affected by Russia, nor by tensions between Moscow and Washington. China should neither form an alliance based on bloc politics nor allow itself to be recruited as an ally by other countries.The current international order is the cornerstone of global stability--but it is not perfect. In 2005, China and Russia issued a joint statement on "the international order in the twenty-first century," which called for the international system to become more just, drawing its legitimacy from the principles and norms of international law. The statement made clear that Beijing and Moscow see the evolution of their relations--from mistrust and competition to partnership and cooperation--as a model for how countries can manage their differences and work together on areas of agreement in a way that supports global order and decreases the chance that the world will descend into great-power conflict and war.

S'Just a few years ago, Latin Americawas on a roll. Its economies, riding on the back of the Chinese juggernaut, were flourishing. A boom in commodity prices and huge volumes of foreign direct investment in agriculture and natural resources generated a golden decade. Ambitious government programs began to reduce inequality. And relations with the United States, long a source of friction, were improving--even as they became less important to the region\'s success.Today the picture looks very different. Latin America\'s economies are grinding to a halt: in 2015, average GDP growth slipped below one percent. Inequality is still declining, but more slowly. And according to the annual Latinobarometro poll, satisfaction with democracy in Latin America is lower than it is in any other region and is at its lowest point in almost a decade, at 37 percent. In Brazil and Mexico, it has descended to just 21 percent and 19 percent, respectively.Yet on one count at least, the lands south of the Rio Grande are faring better than ever: Latin Americans are denouncing corruption as never before. In decades past, residents of the region seemed resigned to the problem, treating it as an ordinary, if lamentable, part of everyday life. In 1973, for example, Argentines elected Juan Peron to a third term as president despite his infamous criminality; as a popular saying put it, "Mujeriego y ladron, pero queremos a Peron" (Philanderer and thief, we still want Peron).Such tolerance is now a thing of the past. According to the same Latinobarometro poll, the region\'s inhabitants identify corruption as their third most important problem, behind crime and unemployment but above inflation and poverty. Latin Americans have also started judging their politicians based on their perceived trustworthiness. Of the five most unpopular chief executives in Latin America today--Brazil\'s Dilma Rousseff, Mexico\'s Enrique Pea Nieto, Paraguay\'s Horacio Cartes, Peru\'s Ollanta Humala, and Venezuela\'s Nicols Maduro--three come from the countries with the worst ratings for government transparency (Brazil, Mexico, and Peru).Several factors explain this change in attitude. First, the economic growth of the last 15 years has created a large middle class (now estimated at almost a third of the region\'s population, according to the World Bank, up from around 20 percent a decade ago, although higher in Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Uruguay) with high expectations. Second, the region has grown more democratic. As the recent economic downturn has highlighted the damage corruption causes, this newly enlarged middle class has used its new freedoms to vent its frustration with those in charge.Foreigners have also played a role. As Latin America has become more integrated into the world economy, international media and civil society organizations have begun to direct intense opprobrium at corrupt leaders and to lavish praise on reformers. Outside forces have also helped the region\'s more independent judiciaries and media outlets expose official malfeasance.        Latin Americans are denouncing corruption as never before.        Edgard Garrido / REUTERS  Mexican President Enrique Pea Nieto and Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff in Mexico City, May 2015.          Together, all these forces have created a combustible mix, and when cases of graft have come to light in recent years, they have sparked major scandals in one country after another. High-level Latin American officials and business leaders have found themselves denounced by the media. Prosecutors and courts have issued indictments, and protesters have taken to the streets. Although few of the governments implicated in the scandals have actually fallen--and few others are likely to--the sheer scale of the social and political protest has been astonishing and represents an important positive trend in a part of the world with an otherwise gloomy forecast.BRAZILIAN BRIBESOf all the region\'s recent uprisings against corruption, the most dramatic has unfolded in Brazil. The problems began in late 2013, a time when popular discontent with the government was already running high. The previous president, Luis Incio Lula da Silva (known as Lula), had been tarnished by a corruption scandal years earlier. Now the economy was stagnating, and protests had begun to erupt over Brazil\'s lavish spending on the coming World Cup. Then, in late 2014, shortly after Rousseff narrowly won reelection, the so-called petrolo scandal hit.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display("dfp-ad-x90_2");    });  The scale of the revelations was unprecedented. In November 2014, federal police arrested 18 people, including senior executives of Petrobras, Brazil\'s state oil company, for corruption in the first raid of the investigation. Numerous firms had paid high-ranking government officials, including members of Rousseff\'s Workers\' Party, enormous sums of money to obtain contracts from Petrobras. The bribes were thought to have totaled around $3 billion. Prosecutors charged executives from more than a dozen of the country\'s largest construction companies with corruption and money laundering. As several Petrobras executives turned state\'s witness, the police investigation, known as Operation Car Wash, continued to expand. Before long, many Brazilians concluded that Rousseff, who served as chair of Petrobras\' board from 2003 to 2010, must be guilty herself. Although she has not been charged, Brazil\'s supreme court has ruled that her predecessor, Lula, can be called in for questioning, and on September 1, his former chief of staff was charged with racketeering, receiving bribes, fraud, and money laundering.Lula was already under intense official scrutiny at the time: just a few months earlier, prosecutors had concluded that they had enough evidence to launch a full investigation into allegations that Brazil\'s biggest building company had paid Lula to lobby overseas on the firm\'s behalf. In yet another case, Rousseff has been accused by Brazil\'s Controller General\'s Office of illegally using funds earmarked for social programs and development to cover up budget deficits. Taken together, all these charges have helped push Rousseff\'s approval ratings down into the single digits; talk of her impeachment is now in the air. As demonstrations continue and the economy languishes--Brazil is now in its worst recession in decades--it\'s looking increasingly likely that Rousseff will not manage to serve out her term, which ends in 2018.Bad as all these revelations have been for Brazil, the public reckoning that has followed can also be read as a sign of progress. The fact that the police, prosecutors, and judges have been willing to investigate the country\'s most powerful politicians and business leaders has highlighted the independence of Brazil\'s judicial system. And the unprecedented level of anger suggests that business as usual will no longer satisfy a Brazilian public increasingly intolerant of high-level corruption.  Joedson Alves / REUTERSAn anticorruption protest in Brasilia, November 2015.Another country north of Brazil has also recently turned a corner. In early 2015, after it emerged that officials had siphoned off millions of dollars in customs revenue, thousands of Guatemalans took to the streets, gathering every Saturday for weeks in the central square of the capital. In May, they forced the resignation of the country\'s vice president and several cabinet ministers. But the protests continued, and on September 1, legislators from President Otto Perez Molina\'s own party stripped him of his immunity. On September 2, he resigned and within hours was jailed on corruption charges--an extraordinary event in a country where politicians have long enjoyed great impunity.The fight against corruption in Guatemala has benefited from outside support. That help has come in the form of the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), which was created in 2006 as part of a larger agreement between the UN and Guatemala. The body, which was initially intended to investigate crimes committed during the civil war, is financed by the European Union, supported by the U.S. embassy, and led by a Colombian; it now numbers more than 200 foreign officials. It has become one of the most powerful instruments in the campaign against corruption. As a high government official told me in August, "It hurts to admit that we are unable to clean up our own house, but it is better that someone else does it than that nobody does."Guatemala\'s example has sparked similar protests across Central America, in neighboring Honduras and to a lesser extent in El Salvador. In Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras, thousands of protesters gather every Friday in a marcha de las antorchas, or "march of the torches," to demand an investigation into the defrauding of the Honduran Institute of Social Security by the governing party. President Juan Orlando Hernndez has attempted to placate the demonstrators by creating a commission similar to the CICIG, although without prosecutorial powers, but so far, these attempts have failed. As long as it lacks the teeth of its Guatemalan counterpart, such a commission is unlikely to satisfy the protesters, and if more scandals come to light, calls for Hernndez\'s resignation will mount. And in El Salvador, there are calls for an external investigation into Alba Petroleos, the subsidized energy venture set up by then Venezuelan President Hugo Chvez several years ago, which is suspected of making financial contributions to El Salvador\'s ruling party.NO MSForeign influence has played a crucial role in Mexico as well. The American press is responsible for unveiling three of the most important corruption cases in recent history: Walmart\'s bribing of Mexican municipal officials (which The New York Times reported on in 2012); the revelation that Luis Videgaray, the country\'s finance minister, had acquired property under suspicious circumstances (a story The Wall Street Journal broke in 2014); and the concealed purchase of multimillion-dollar condos in Manhattan and elsewhere by a former governor (another story broken by the Times, this one in 2015).Yet Mexico\'s domestic media have also done their part. The radio reporter Carmen Aristegui, the newsweekly Proceso, and the daily Reforma have helped expose numerous scandals. Aristegui revealed that the $7 million modernist mansion in Mexico City built for the Pea Nieto family was in fact owned by a company to which the president had awarded hundreds of millions of dollars in public contracts and that was headed by a personal friend of his. A government investigation has since exonerated Pea Nieto, but many in Mexico have dismissed the inquiry as a cover-up. Other accusations have been leveled at the interior minister and several governors. These scandals have all generated a great deal of anger and unhappiness in Mexican society. But so far, not much more has come of them.  Edgard Garrido / REUTERSMexican Finance Minister Luis Videgaray in the National Congress in Mexico City, October 2015.Yet public opinion has come to matter more and more in today\'s democratic Mexico. Online social networks now provide the new middle class with an outlet halfway between public protest and private complaint: Mexicans use Facebook and Twitter to vent their anger and share information (not all of it accurate) about high-level corruption. This allows for a measure of catharsis but has yet to produce actual change: although many think that Pea Nieto\'s government is Mexico\'s most corrupt since the late 1980s, so far calls for the president\'s resignation have foundered.A major corruption scandal is causing a similar reaction in Chile. It began in February 2015 with accusations of influence peddling against the son and daughter-in-law of President Michelle Bachelet. Other scandals soon emerged, involving tax fraud and campaign finance crimes on the part of opposition leaders and members of the governing coalition, several of whom were jailed. As of May, most had been released, but some were under house arrest. Even Marco Enriquez-Ominami, a former independent candidate for president and one of Chile\'s most popular politicians, has been caught up in a controversy regarding campaign finance, according to Chilean media reports. Large financial and mining conglomerates--one of them led by the ex-son-in-law of Chile\'s former dictator, Augusto Pinochet--have been accused of fraudulently contributing to electoral campaigns.Yet as in Mexico, the scandals have prompted only muted protests so far. That may be a consequence of their relatively small scale. Historically, Chile\'s has ranked as one of the more honest governments in Latin America, and the amounts at stake in the country\'s recent scandals pale in comparison to those in Brazil and Mexico: the most serious charge against a Chilean official involves a loan of $10 million.Of all the region\'s recent uprisings against corruption, the most dramatic have been in Brazil.Yet the allegations still represent the most serious challenge Bachelet has faced in her two terms in power. Although she tried to show that she takes the issue seriously by asking for the resignation of her entire cabinet in May and by calling for a new constitution, by August her approval rating had dropped by 30 percentage points in one year. Popular protests are likely to become louder unless Chile\'s elites take genuine steps to reduce corruption, especially if the country\'s copper-dependent economy doesn\'t pick up soon. But once again, this represents good news as well as bad. Chile\'s independent and honest judiciary and its free press were central to uncovering the corruption scandals--an important sign of the growing effectiveness of Chile\'s democratic institutions.Even in Venezuela, where flagrant corruption is still the norm, there are signs that the public\'s patience is running out. According to Latinobarometro, Venezuela is the region\'s second least transparent country, and at the end of 2015, Maduro was its third most unpopular president. The United States recently leaked accusations that many of the country\'s leaders--including Diosdado Cabello, the head of the National Assembly and Maduro\'s closest aide--have used illegal means to enrich themselves immensely, partly through links with Colombian drug cartels. In June, the deterioration of Venezuela\'s economy and the increase in violence and human rights violations forced Maduro to call elections for December. Although candidates and voters mostly focused on the economy, violence, and repression, more and more of them raised corruption as well.A GLASS HALF FULLYet there are exceptions to this trend. In Argentina, there are few positive developments in the fight against corruption. The outgoing vice president, Amado Boudou, is awaiting trial for corruption, but many suspect the charges will be dismissed. Allegations also surround outgoing President Cristina Fernndez de Kirchner, whose net wealth surged to a reported $6 million over the 13 years she and her late husband ruled the country, but the chances of a prosecution are slim. Outsiders have less influence in Argentina than in many of its neighbors--the country\'s tradition of Peronist nationalism makes it hostile to perceived meddling. And the public seems resigned to the status quo: although hundreds of thousands of Argentines joined demonstrations when the prosecutor Alberto Nisman died under mysterious circumstances--as he was investigating Kirchner in connection with the 1994 bombing of a Buenos Aires Jewish community center--they have remained stubbornly passive when it comes to corruption.  Marcos Brindicci / REUTERSA march in honor of the late state prosecutor Alberto Nisman in Mar del Plata, Argentina, February 2015.  The people of Nicaragua, meanwhile, seem even more complacent. President Daniel Ortega is currently focused on an enormous undertaking: an attempt to build a second interoceanic canal just north of the existing Panama Canal. A Chinese businessman has agreed to underwrite the cost, which could reach up to $100 billion. Some Nicaraguans think that the businessman is working for the Chinese government, but given China\'s economic problems, it is in no position to foot the bill, and more than two years after the project was announced, excavation has yet to begin. Many Nicaraguans believe that the whole venture is nothing more than an elaborate scheme designed to enrich the Ortega family and that no canal will ever be built. Yet Nicaraguans have done little to register their displeasure: there have been no massive protests, for example.As all these stories suggest, corruption remains deeply embedded in Latin American political and social life. Some countries have seen little improvement from the bad old days decades ago. Yet the outraged reactions to the wave of scandals currently sweeping the continent may be the first sign that Latin American publics are no longer prepared to tolerate systemic dishonesty in their governments. The region\'s new middle classes, aided by pressure from abroad and by increasingly confident and independent domestic institutions, have begun demanding better governance.The outcome of all these movements is still uncertain. Some may generate new institutions: autonomous controller\'s offices, more powerful and independent judiciaries, greater transparency, and more active and conscious civil societies. Others may take a populist turn, as candidates for office run on anti-elite platforms. And in some countries, the movements will subside. But in all cases, something will have changed in Latin America, and much for the better. '

S'As growth slows in mature economies across the developed world, economic inequality has reached new heights. Defined in terms of the shares of disposable income of households across the economic spectrum, adjusted for varying needs, inequality today in the United States is significantly higher than it was a generation ago. The same is true in the United Kingdom, and even less laissez-faire countries, such as Germany and Sweden, have seen inequality increase dramatically.The main reason for the rise in inequality is the explosion in gains accruing to those at the very top of the income distribution. But the circumstances of those at the bottom have contributed, too. According to government calculations, the poverty rate in the United States in 2014 stood some four percentage points higher than it did 40 years earlier. In Germany, poverty, as measured by the EU standard, has risen by nearly half since 2000. Europe as a whole has made little progress in aiding the poor in recent years, despite the EU\'s pledge to lift 20 million Europeans out of poverty or social exclusion by 2020.Global leaders have taken note, and they are worried. U.S. President Barack Obama called rising income inequality "the defining challenge of our time," and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, warned of "the dark shadow it casts across the global economy." But what officials have not said, by and large, is what they would do about it. Many seem to have resigned themselves to an ever-less-equal world.The good news is that present levels of inequality are not inevitable. If governments are serious about tackling inequality--and that is a big if--then there are concrete steps they can take. Some of these actions might be controversial and difficult, and they would create losers as well as winners. But they are the best practical way to make a dent in a frustratingly persistent problem.AN INCOME FOR EVERYONEThe standard explanation of rising inequality centers on supply and demand. Forty years ago, the Dutch economist Jan Tinbergen described a race between education, which increases the supply of skilled workers, and technological change, which increases the demand for them. Since demand has grown faster than supply, the premium paid to skilled workers has increased, widening the wage differential between them and their unskilled counterparts. Later, globalization entered the picture, causing jobs for low-educated workers in many places to disappear. The policy prescription that flows from this explanation is for societies to invest more in education and training. Such calls are justified, but there is more to the story.  Mariana Bazo / ReutersInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Christine Lagarde (R) talks at a news conference next to Mexico\'s central bank Governor Agustin Carstens, Lima, Peru, October 2015.For one thing, the drivers of technological change and globalization are not exogenous, uncontrollable forces. Most technological advancements are the product of decisions made by research managers, businesspeople, investors, governments, and consumers. These decisions affect the degree to which technological change favors skilled or unskilled workers and, more generally, the degree to which it favors capital or labor. A company may, for example, decide to invest in robotizing its warehouses and developing drones to deliver its goods. Those changes would reduce the demand for labor, and the company would no longer have to rely on a work force that wants to be properly treated and paid. But consumers may prefer to deal with a human and not a robot, and there is no guarantee that this preference can be conveyed via the marketplace.To make sure that the concerns of all stakeholders are represented, governments should take an active interest in the direction of technological change; after all, their grants and labs are responsible for much of the underlying research. When allocating public research funds, governments should consider employment and other social needs. It might make sense, for instance, to shift priorities from driverless cars, which will likely reduce jobs, to technology that helps the elderly stay in their homes, which would increase the demand for caregivers.The standard story about inequality is also incomplete in that it focuses on individual earnings--the gap between pay at the top and pay at the bottom. It ignores taxes and social transfers, which play a large role in determining how much income a household receives. Since around 1980, developed countries have significantly unwound their policies of redistributing income. To undo the damage, the first requirement is to make income taxes more progressive. In the United States and the United Kingdom, the top marginal rate should rise from 45 percent to 65 percent--closer to the rates that prevailed for much of the twentieth century.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display("dfp-ad-x90_2");    });  Governments should take an active interest in the direction of technological change.Governments interested in reducing inequality should also reform the way they tax the transfer of wealth. Namely, they should broaden the estate tax into a tax on all wealth received over one\'s lifetime in the form of bequests and gifts. The tax would be designed to reward those who gave away their wealth broadly, rather than concentrating it on one recipient. (John Stuart Mill argued in 1861 that "the State should favour the diffusion rather than the concentration of wealth.") And to compound the effect, the revenue from the wealth-transfer tax should be used to fund a minimum inheritance for everyone on reaching the age of 18. Such egalitarianism would undoubtedly promote equality of opportunity.When it comes to government transfers, states should start by focusing on children. In the United Kingdom, the Child Benefit offers a weekly allowance to parents for every child they raise. That transfer should be better targeted by making it taxable as personal income, which would reduce the size of the benefit for those in higher tax brackets. The United States, by contrast, has no such universal program, and the result has been telling: whereas child poverty has fallen sharply in the United Kingdom, in the United States, it rose by nearly a third from 1969 to 2013. Introducing a child-benefit program in the United States would make a major dent in child poverty and represent a powerful investment in future generations.Just as some governments are providing what is in effect a basic income for children, they should offer everyone what I have called a "participation income." Under this scheme, benefits would go only to those who participated in society--defined broadly to include not just employment but also self-employment, education, training, job hunting, and caregiving, with exceptions made for the ill or disabled. The participation income would replace the personal tax exemption, by offering everyone the same amount of cash. Although the idea may sound radical, it has found support in the past under the name "negative income tax"--a proposal made by no less a free-market economist than Milton Friedman, whereby citizens whose incomes fell below a certain threshold would receive government payments.Governments interested in reducing inequality should reform the way they tax the transfer of wealth.Reducing income inequality is not just about taxes and spending; governments also need to tackle unemployment. Here, the United States has performed better than many developed countries, with its unemployment rate now standing at five percent. But there was a time after World War II when unemployment in such countries as the United Kingdom had fallen to around one percent. Back then, people regarded with horror the prospect that the rate might rise to 2.5 percent; today, the y-axis on the U.S. unemployment chart published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics begins at four percent.Better is possible. To start, governments should establish an explicit target for unemployment, just as many do with inflation. This is not such a radical idea. The U.S. Federal Reserve, for example, is already mandated by Congress to promote "maximum employment." Then, political leaders would have to radically reconsider the way they battle unemployment. Past efforts to make the labor market more flexible--the very reform advocated by such bodies as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the International Monetary Fund--have not succeeded in returning countries to the low unemployment rates of the postwar decades. In large part, that\'s because they have focused almost exclusively on the supply side of the labor market. On the demand side, the government can act as an employer of last resort by offering guaranteed jobs. Again, the concept is nothing new: in 1978, the U.S. Congress passed the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act, which authorized the president to form "reservoirs of public employment." Jobs are only part of the story, of course, since many people who work remain poor--hence the need to raise the minimum wage.SPREADING THE WEALTHStates wishing to fight inequality will also have to rethink their approach to capital and wealth. Although wealth is much more evenly spread than it was a century ago, there has not been a corresponding democratization of the economic decisions associated with capital. A person with a retirement fund, such as a 401(k) in the United States, indirectly benefits from the dividends paid on shares in a company owned by that fund yet has no say in the decisions made by that company. It is time to rebalance the power among stakeholders. That means taking inequality into consideration when making judgments about violations of antitrust law; after all, as the judge Learned Hand pointed out, Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890 "to put an end to great aggregations of capital because of the helplessness of the individual before them." And it means ensuring that negotiations about trade deals involve not just businesses but workers and consumer representatives, too.In terms of the ownership of wealth, plans to reduce inequality have fixated on taxing the rich, but as much attention should be paid to increasing the wealth of small savers. To that end, governments should introduce accounts for small savers that guarantee a positive return in excess of inflation. In the United Kingdom, for much of the past five years, small savers have experienced a negative return on investment, adjusting for inflation. Inflation-indexed savings vehicles would help people accumulate savings, and their use should find support across the political spectrum.But governments need to look beyond individual wealth to national wealth, since inequality is also a function of the public\'s share of state assets. Politicians around the globe obsess over public finances, yet they focus almost exclusively on national debt. Instead, they should look at the overall position of the state: both liabilities and assets. When considering what a state owns in addition to what it owes, things do not look good. The United Kingdom restored its wealth after World War II, and by 1979, its net worth equaled about three-quarters of national income. But after a wave of privatization in the 1980s, the country\'s net worth fell sharply, and by 1997, it had nearly hit zero. In the United States, the government\'s net worth peaked at around two-thirds of national income at the beginning of the 1980s, fell to a tenth in 1994, and is now negative.  Issei Kato / ReutersA humanoid robot works side by side with employees in the assembly line at a factory in Kazo, north of Tokyo, Japan, July 2015.Given this sorry state of affairs, the logical thing for a government to do is bring together its assets in a sovereign wealth fund and design its fiscal policy to build up state net worth. This would not be tantamount to nationalization, since the state would not acquire controlling interests in corporations. Rather, the state would purchase minority stakes in assets that yielded an income, which it could use to finance part of its spending. In the medium term, by acquiring shares in firms benefiting from increased automation, the state would reap some of the increased profits resulting from such macroeconomic developments. As the economist Laura Tyson has said, the implications of robotization depend on "who owns the robots." If the state gets a significant chunk of the profits--and after all, it paid for much of the development--then the income will be spread far more widely.ANOTHER WAY  The Nigerian writer Ben Okri began a recent poem with: "They say there is only one way for politics." But, he concluded, "there\'s always a new way." In the fight against excessive inequality, there are alternative ways forward, yet they are not necessarily novel. U.S. Senator John Sherman, a Republican from Ohio, introduced his landmark 1890 Antitrust Act because he believed that among all the country\'s problems, "none is more threatening than the inequality of condition, of wealth, and opportunity." The philosopher Thomas Paine proposed a minimum inheritance as far back as 1797.Nor do these various proposals need to reduce inequality at the expense of economic performance. To the contrary, if properly designed, the measures can in fact improve the performance of the economy. A minimum inheritance, for example, could help young people finance their education, start a business, or buy property. A higher minimum wage, meanwhile, could nudge employers to develop higher-wage, higher-productivity opportunities for their employees.Even in today\'s globalized world, there is room for national governments to take steps to reduce inequality. For too long, politicians concerned about inequality and poverty have portrayed the problems as regrettable but unfixable. Yet by and large, the solutions lie in their own hands. '

S"Aiyar is an Indian journalist who moved to Brussels in 2009 with her family when her husband, who is Spanish, took a position with the European Commission. This exceptionally engaging book records her impressions of Europe from the distinctive perspective of someone who was brought up in India and also spent a significant portion of her career in China. Most interesting are her street-level insights into cultural difference. To someone accustomed to the logistical chaos and conversational informality of Asian streets, the manicured boulevards and airy stores of Brussels appear cold and dead. Attuned to an informal economy, she investigates the traditional cheese industry in the Italian region of Emilia-Romagna and discovers that around 100,000 nearly invisible Asian workers support it. (The title of the book's British edition is Punjabi Parmesan.) Aiyar, who is accustomed to living in a riotously multicultural and multilingual country, questions Belgium's stated commitment to those forms of diversity. Not all of her points ring true--for example, she exaggerates Chinese influence in Europe--but this book will offer any reader fresh insights into not-so-old Europe. blank"

S'The demands of combat require infantry troops to form strong emotional relationships based on trust and mutual dependence, to become a "band of brothers," in the historian Stephen Ambrose\'s phrase. At various points in U.S. history, military leaders and civilian defense officials have relied on that fact to resist the integration of African Americans, gays, and women into the infantry, arguing that their presence would disrupt the bonding process. In each case, the demands of maintaining an all-volunteer army, along with rapid changes in social mores, rendered that resistance futile: all three groups are now part of the American fighting force. MacKenzie confronts the main arguments offered by opponents of allowing women to fight, including women\'s supposed physical weakness and emotionalism and the concern that sexual tension between male and female fighters would lead to problems. She does not deny that the presence of women will change the character of the infantry but argues that it might be a net benefit. This is a vigorous contribution to the debate on women in the armed forces, although there is some tension between MacKenzie\'s demonstration that women can cope perfectly well with the demands of combat and her distaste for the militarism and nationalism that she associates with preparations for combat. blank'

S"They don't make them like General Jack Galvin anymore. Galvin, who recently passed away, served during two problematic periods in the history of the U.S. Army (the late 1940s and the post-Vietnam years) and two very successful ones (the early 1960s, when the army modernized, and the 1980s, when it was rebuilt). He held two combatant commands: Southern Command, which he headed during a critical time, when insurgencies were spreading throughout Latin America, and European Command, where he was the last Cold War-era supreme allied commander of NATO forces in Europe. A son of New England, he began and ended his academic career there, serving as the dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy after leaving military service. A writer as well as a battlefield commander--Galvin wrote, among other things, a very good book on the Minutemen--he was the epitome of the soldier-scholar, a type less common in today's U.S. military, although his protege, David Petraeus, is of that mold. Galvin's memoir (introduced by an admiring Petraeus) is a characteristically modest, wry, and thoughtful account not only of leadership but also of the rise, fall, and rise again of U.S. military power in the second half of the twentieth century. And it is, as well, a reminder that now and again, one comes across generals with the stuff of greatness in them. blank"

S'This challenging book takes aim at "globalist" thinking. Porter argues that Western security elites increasingly believe that globalization and technological changes have made the world smaller but also more threatening. Porter thinks that phenomenon is more imagined than real, and much of his book is an effort to show that territoriality, geography, and state power still matter. He reminds readers that even in the age of drones and cyberwarfare, it is still difficult for most countries or nonstate groups to project power across great distances. Porter is eager to puncture the "myth" of globalism because he sees it as the core idea behind U.S. military activism and hegemonic ambitions. After all, if threats to the homeland can come from anywhere, the entire world must become the United States\' zone of operation. For Porter, such thinking opens the door to what the historian Charles Beard called "perpetual war for perpetual peace." Porter may be right, but even if the world is not a tightly integrated village, hiding behind borders no longer seems to be an option. blank'

S'Despite the similarities between ISIS and previous theocratic revolutionaries, from the Abbasids to the Wahhabis, the rise of the Islamic State represents something new and modern. The technologies of globalization offer contemporary radical extremists opportunities to reach mass audiences their predecessors could never have imagined, and ISIS has exploited these technologies more successfully than any of its contemporaries in the Islamist world. Stern and Berger\'s book provides the most compelling analysis yet of the group\'s creative and sophisticated propaganda efforts and its unprecedented use of social media. ISIS has several thousand active online supporters who operate in disciplined regiments. After the group posts something to the Internet--say, a beheading video--and it is authenticated, a second-tier regiment takes to Twitter to "retweet the link with a hashtag, then retweet each other\'s tweets and write new tweets." At coordinated times, online hashtag campaigns generate hundreds of similar tweets to create a "Twitter storm." Other members upload the material to multiple platforms so that it remains available even if Internet providers pull the content down. If "al Qaeda was publicity-shy," write Stern and Berger, "ISIS, in contrast, is a publicity whore."Read the full review.  blank'

S'World headlines blare the news that negotiators in Paris have reached a global climate change agreement. Yet underneath the soaring rhetoric were hard politics that can tell a lot about the longevity of the deal.As the Paris climate negotiations moved toward their final days, delegates\' focus shifted from the technical to the political. The negotiating text had been stripped of its most baroque complications, and what was left reflected core differences among countries.Navigating this phase of the talks requires an understanding of the shifting alliances among nearly 200 countries, dramatized through the fierce public battles over how to even characterize the talks in Paris. India and South Africa tried to solidify developing country alliances by accusing the United States of undermining the fundamental negotiating principle of equity. The United States and the European Union talked up the emergence of an informal "High Ambition Coalition" among countries spanning the traditional rich-poor divide.By defining the narrative of the negotiations as a fight for either "climate equity" or "climate ambition," countries hope to focus political and media pressure on those who, they claim, are blocking progress. This is tactically understandable but obscures what is really going on.Climate change negotiations are too often described as a kind of environmental cold war between developed and developing countries. But this dynamic has not held for over a decade. The implications of climate change, and its solutions, are too central to countries\' core national interests for them to base their negotiating positions just on some abstract sense of "historic responsibility." Countries\' interests are likewise too diverse for them to make permanent alliances simply on the basis of levels of per capita income. Oil producers, forested nations, high-tech trading centers, and low-lying or desert countries all have distinct interests to protect.  Mal Langsdon / ReutersEnvironmentalists hold a banner which reads, "Crank up the Action" at a protest demonstration near the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France, December 12, 2015.A better analogy for Paris is major European powers\' alliance building and periodic conflicts in the late nineteenth century. All major powers had a shared interest in maintaining stability, but they struggled to reconcile their long-term goal with the temptations of securing tactical advantages of power or territory. The mismanagement of these tensions led--inadvertently--to the disastrous wars of the twentieth century. Shared strategic intentions do not automatically lead to successful tactical diplomacy.The "major powers" in this case are China, India, the United States, and the EU. On the opening day of the Paris talks, leaders from all of these countries committed to delivering a binding agreement to keep global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius. There was no reason to doubt their sincerity. Given the rush of bilateral talks among those powers leading up to the Paris meeting, publicly blocking an agreement would incur significant geopolitical costs. But below broad strategic intent lies a range of tactics based on national interests and how they interact.Only time, and the implementation of commitments, will show how durable this new alliance is in practice.In the United States, things have changed a lot since the Bush years, when the United States and the EU were at odds while China and India worked closely together. In the run-up to Paris, the United States and EU positions have moved closer together. Both have high ambitions for a strong, enduring climate agreement that brings in the major developing countries on (relatively) equal footing. U.S. President Barack Obama needs such a victory to secure his legacy and protect Democratic domestic energy policy. The EU needs it to show its public a return on years of climate leadership.China, meanwhile, is steering a careful course between shouldering the responsibilities of an emerging superpower and its traditional role as defender of the developing countries. China fears an overly restrictive agreement and intrusive monitoring of its domestic progress. Even more, it wants to avoid blame for any failure in Paris. India felt vulnerable to ending up with a deal that constrains future growth. Paris commits countries to review climate action every five years, and India knows it will soon be under intense pressure to follow China\'s commitment to peak emissions.None of the major powers could decisively shape the Paris deal just by working with their closest allies. Each pair makes up only around 30 percent of global emissions. They all need to align with other groups. The largest are the Least Developed Countries (LDC) Group and the (overlapping) Africa Group. These two have historically focused on trying to win funding to help them adapt to climate impacts. A powerful new player was the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), which brings together countries most at risk from sea level rise and extreme weather events, from middle-income Barbados to large low-income countries such as Bangladesh and the Philippines. The CVF also wants funding, but its main priority is to secure binding action to limit climate change to below 1.5 degrees Celsius. The CVF complements the more established Small Island Developing States (SIDS) Group, which has similar goals but less political clout, in trying to avoid a low-ambition tradeoff among the large powers.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display("dfp-ad-x90_2");    });    Charles Platiau / ReutersThe slogan "No Plan B" is projected on the Eiffel Tower as part of the World Climate Change Conference 2015 (COP21) in Paris, France, December 11, 2015.This crowded field organizes into a core triangle of relationships. In one corner are China and India, trying to persuade the LDCs and Africa that working together puts more pressure on richer countries to give assistance. And so they talk up "equity" and "differentiation." Through this alliance, they hoped to resist pressure for stronger rules progressively limiting developing country emissions. This dynamic was exemplified by the outrage at one U.S. suggestion that emerging economies could--voluntarily--help poorer countries financially. The suggestion was condemned as an attack on the core principle of equity that underlies the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC): that developed countries should help poorer countries because they had "historic responsibility" for emitting more carbon, and growing rich, in the past. The impact of their protest was rather undermined, though, by the fact that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese leader Xi Jinping had announced support packages for poorer countries only a few days before.In another corner, the United States and EU are aiming to attract the CVF, Africa Group, and SIDS with the prospect of a strong emission reductions treaty covering all major emitters, where every five years countries would have to submit increased targets in order to drive global emission cuts nearer to 1.5 degrees Celsius. They also promised a larger share of funding to help aligned countries deal with climate change. The United States and EU hoped that such offers would forestall demands for sharply increased funding after 2020 and weaken arguments for compensation for climate damage.This competition for the affection of the developing country groups puts them in a strong position. There is always a temptation to play both sides, but that would be a dangerous and difficult game. These groups are loosely knit coalitions of countries with wildly different balances of interests. Many Africa Group countries are also OPEC members. They are thus more analogous to the fragmented Holy Roman Empire than to Chancellor Otto Bismarck\'s Germany. Countries have different regional allegiances, and the sheer number of members makes quick political decision-making very difficult. Under pressure, they have a tendency to splinter into smaller regional groupings like the East Africa states. Individual countries also come under intense diplomatic pressure from major countries with which they have strong commercial ties to shift position.  If developing country groups tried to overplay their hand, they could have forced an alliance to form along the final side of the triangle, the one between the United States and China. If those two powers dictated the final deal in order to prevent total failure, it would most likely have resulted in a worst-case scenario of weak mitigation rules and low financial commitments.As the negotiations neared the end, there was an intense war of rhetoric among major countries attempting to claim the moral high ground over whether "climate ambition" or "climate equity" defined the negotiations. However, underneath the smoke of battle, the final geometry of alliances proved to be dominated, at least temporarily, by the so-called High Ambition Coalition. Although it is a rather fragile structure, in the end, it attracted over 100 countries, including the United States, the EU, Brazil, SIDS, and the CVF to rally around an ambitious agreement of tough mitigation rules and moderately increased funding pledges. It was this alliance that shaped the final deal, despite some last minute hard bargaining by China to weaken oversight of the transparency rules.The endgame politics in Paris suggests that there is now a core majority of countries in the UNFCCC that see their national interest as maximizing global efforts to control climate change, even at the expense of aid funding or strict "equity" in the deal. For them, the benefits of preventing dangerous climate change clearly outweigh the costs of phasing out fossil fuel use. These national interest dynamics, not abstract principles, are the political foundation--strong or weak--on which the Paris Agreement is built. Only time, and the implementation of commitments, will show how durable this new alliance is in practice. '

S'The lead packaged of the January/February 2015 issue of Foreign Affairs deals with inequality. To complement the individual articles, we decided to ask a broad pool of experts for their take. As with previous surveys, we approached dozens of authorities with deep specialized expertise relevant to the question at hand, together with a few leading generalists in the field. Participants were asked to state whether they agreed or disagreed with a proposition and to rate their confidence level in their opinion; the answers from those who responded are below:If left unaddressed, economic inequality will cause major political upheavals in the developed world over the next generation.Results:Full Responses:DARON ACEMOGLU is Elizabeth and James Killian Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Agree, Confidence Level 8It depends what aspects of economic inequality and what types of political upheavals. It is clear that the increasing share of national income captured by the top one percent (or the top 0.1 percent) is highly visible right now and worries many citizens and pundits. It also motivates the left. This aspect of economic inequality could certainly lead to some upheaval if left unaddressed. It is probably the most important factor that fueled the Occupy movement and the more recent rise of Bernie Sanders in the United States and the election of Jeremy Corbyn in the United Kingdom.But this effect is probably not "major." Neither Sanders nor Corbyn is likely to get elected to office, and their influence on mainstream politicians will probably remain limited. U.S. President Barack Obama, for example, has rightly worried about the top one percent\'s rising share of income and the potential negative effects on social mobility, but he has not adopted any radical, or even moderate, policies to counter economic inequality--not that such economic policies would be simple to pass through Congress at the moment or would be likely to be silver bullets.Another potential political impact of the increased share of income of the top one percent could be more major: the growing political power of mega-billionaires. With the gutting of limits on campaign contributions and the total lack of oversight of lobbying activities in Washington, a mega-billionaire, such as Sheldon Adelson and the Koch brothers, can now wield enormous power. The most effective way of curbing such power is permanent vigilance by the media, civil society, and competing interest groups--with some help from institutional checks (the latter being unfortunately less effective in the United States than in other Western nations at the moment, so the United States would probably have to be doubly vigilant against such encroachment).The aspect of economic inequality that is likely to have the most frequent major political consequences is not the share of the top one percent but poverty at the bottom. The health of a dynamic market economy depends on a level playing field, so that those at the bottom are not excluded and their offspring have a chance to rise up and contribute to society by working, producing, and innovating. The United States does a fairly lousy job of protecting those at the bottom and a very lousy job of giving their offspring a good shot at success. There is also increasing economic inequality in Finland, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, and elsewhere in Europe. But those societies are doing a much better job of protecting their less well-off citizens and their families, so that the long-term consequences of increasing inequality, even if it translates into a much greater share held by their top one percent, will not be pernicious.The United States may end up paying a much greater economic price and, for that reason, ultimately suffer much more significant political upheaval because it is complacent about the plight of its poor. So our priority should be not to fret endlessly about the top one percent--although that certainly does deserve to be noted and taken seriously--but to wake up to the terrible long-term costs of neglecting the less fortunate citizens and their children.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display("dfp-ad-x90_2");    });  DANIELLE ALLENis Director of the Edmond J.

Why are non-college-educated white males so angry? I\'d argue that it is because they\'ve seen 35 years of stagnating incomes, declining job opportunities, and increasing economic marginalization. The falling fortunes of non-college-educated working-class Americans is the face of inequality that worries me most. It\'s an irony that although Republicans don\'t like to talk about inequality their party is arguably being riven by it.ANDREW G. BERG is Assistant Director of the IMF\'s Research Department.Agree, Confidence Level 7JARED BERNSTEIN is a Senior Fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.Agree, Confidence Level 7There\'s already simmering dissatisfaction, if not anger, among the electorate that is being expressed as nativism in the current U.S. presidential campaign. The sense that the game is rigged against ordinary folks is widespread and even bipartisan. If that doesn\'t change--if it remains unaddressed or worsens due to the toxic interaction of highly concentrated wealth and money-soaked politics--political upheaval is a possible outcome.MARK BLYTHis Eastman Professor of Political Economy at Brown University.Agree, Confidence Level 8A global economy facing structural deflation with high levels of private and public debt, embedded within an inequality skew of planetary proportions (as a Credit Suisse report shows) that is on the cusp of robotizing everything. Yeah--that\'s stable, sure.FRANOIS BOURGUIGNONis Professor of Economics at the Paris School of Economics, former Chief Economist of the World Bank, and the author ofThe Globalization of Inequality.Agree, Confidence Level 8The issue of constantly rising inequality beyond an already high level, and the sociopolitical risk it entails, applies mostly to the United States. For the time being, the situation is rather different in other developed countries: inequality is lower and seems to have stabilized over the last decade. The assumption of "left unaddressed" is also debatable. One may argue that inequality issues will be addressed precisely as soon as the probability of "major political upheaval" becomes significant. However, this will not prevent inequality from causing serious economic damage.PAUL COLLIERis Professor of Economics and Public Policy at the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford.Agree, Confidence Level 4I think there is a danger that rising inequality will feed on itself, through a gradual undermining of social cohesion, leading to unstable, polarized, and sporadically populist politics.TYLER COWEN is Professor of Economics at George Mason University.Disagree, Confidence Level 7Inequality is correlated with political disengagement, not with political upheaval. That kind of turmoil is better predicted by rising expectations.ANGUS DEATON is the Dwight D. Eisenhower Professor of Economics and International Affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs and the Economics Department at Princeton University.Agree, Confidence Level 8Our new work on rising death rates in middle-aged white Americans is yet more evidence of the consequences of being left behind, of not sharing growth more equally. At the top, there is danger of plutocracy. We are not there yet, but the danger is real.JAMES K. GALBRAITH holds the Lloyd M. Bentsen Jr. Chair in Government/Business Relations and a professorship of Government at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, the University of Texas at Austin.Neutral, Confidence Level 5There is no known method for predicting "major political upheavals." Nor is it necessary to predicate action on the possibility that some major upheaval might otherwise occur. As such, sensible control of excessive inequality is sensible policy.JACOB HACKER is Director of the Institution for Social and Policy Studies and Stanley B. Resor Professor of Political Science at Yale University.Agree, Confidence Level 7The evidence is accumulating that rising economic inequality undermines economic opportunity and political equality. Citizens of developed democracies are becoming more aware of and concerned about this reality (which, of course, varies in severity and salience across nations). As awareness and concern rise, the incentive to mobilize citizens in response to rising inequality grows. Whether this mobilization will be constructive or destructive--leading to egalitarian political and economic reforms or angry reactions to scapegoats or economically destructive policies--that is the fundamental question.FREDRICK C. HARRISis Professor of Political Science and Director of the Center on African American Politics and Society at Columbia University. He is also a Nonresident Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution.Strongly Agree, Confidence Level 8DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN is President of the American Action Forum and is a former Director of the Congressional Budget Office.Disagree, Confidence Level 5There is a difference between addressing inequality and addressing poverty and growth in low-income populations. Inequality is less of a big deal than the latter.LANE KENWORTHY is Professor of Sociology and Political Science at the University of Arizona.Disagree, Confidence Level 6I\'m interpreting "left unaddressed" to mean that the top one percent\'s share of income will stay at its current (high) level. If we return to the rate of economic growth we averaged between 1870 and 2007, and particularly if wages in the middle and below increase, I think it\'s unlikely that economic inequality will cause political upheavals. That\'s what our experience in the 1980s and 1990s suggests. If inequality continues to rise or economic growth slows and wages remain stagnant, all bets are off.WOJCIECH KOPCZUK is Professor of Economics and International and Public Affairs at Columbia University\'s School of International and Public Affairs.Disagree, Confidence Level 6The primary factor behind the evolution of inequality has been technological change, and as a result there is no easy fix to it. Predicting where we are going to be 20 years from now is just guesswork. I tend to be optimistic that in the long run technological progress benefits all; that\'s what prior waves of innovation taught us.BRANKO MILANOVIC is Lead Economist in the World Bank Development Research Group and a Visiting Professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy.Agree, Confidence Level 8I don\'t think the question is very clearly posed. National inequality within a domestic population may have some (more limited) effect, but global inequality (that between countries), by spilling into migration and increasing national inequalities, might have much more of an effect.KIMBERLY J. MORGAN is Professor of Political Science and International Affairs at George Washington University.Agree, Confidence Level 7I believe we already see a rising upheaval in the United States, where we now have a very high degree of political polarization and, as a result, an angry political discourse. As scholars such as Nolan McCarty, Keith T. Poole, and Howard Rosenthal have shown, inequality and political polarization have risen and fallen in tandem for at least 100 years. And we know from other parts of the world and historical time periods that economic inequality can breed social and political acrimony, and even violence. Economic inequality is one of the major challenges of our time, and we must grapple with it not only because of its wider political ramifications but also because of its consequences for the well-being of our citizens.JERRY Z. MULLER is Ordinary Professor and Chair at the Catholic University of America.Disagree, Confidence Level 6The "developed world" is too varied to hazard valid generalizations. But some of what seems likely for the United States will also hold elsewhere. Economic inequality is likely to increase in the United States, not least because the interaction of familial structures (more stable and education-oriented two-parent families at the top; less stable one-parent families with less time and inclination for education at the bottom) and economic trends (the declining market value of physical labor and of routine mental labor, increasing inequality of market rewards) is leading to greater polarization of human capital endowments.That is to say, social classes are becoming more caste-like. That will not necessarily lead to political upheaval. First, because it is far from clear that most people equate relative inequality with inequity. If the absolute standard of living rises, however slowly; if fundamental needs for food, shelter, and medical care are met by welfare state provisions; and if the means of information and entertainment provide an outlet for emotional and intellectual energies; then one can well imagine inequality with political volatility perhaps, but without political upheaval.JONATHAN OSTRY is Deputy Director of the Research Department (RES) at the International Monetary Fund.Strongly Agree, Confidence Level 10BRUNO PALIERis CNRS Research Director at the Center for European Studies and Co-Director of the Laboratory for Interdisciplinary Evaluation of Public Policies at Sciences Po.Strongly Agree, Confidence Level 8A lot of research shows that current political turmoil in the world--and also the development of extreme parties (especially in Europe)--are explained by increasing inequality. There are too many losers in the last wave of globalization. The problem was reinforced by the financial crisis and now by the disappearance of many jobs due to technological changes. If not balanced, these unequal developments will lead the losers to want to get their revenge. That has led to catastrophes in the past.EMMANUEL SAEZ is Professor of Economicsand Director of theCenter for Equitable Growth at University of California, Berkeley.Agree, Confidence Level 4REIHAN SALAM is Executive Editor of National Review.Neutral, Confidence Level 7One important variable is the extent to which economic divides map onto ethnocultural or ethnolinguistic divides. If wealth is concentrated in the hands of a market-dominant ethnocultural minority, while members of some other large ethnocultural community are generally in the lower economic strata of the population, I would expect conflict. In contrast, if the society in question is relatively cohesive, I\'d expect fewer threats to the legitimacy of its core institutions, even if the level of economic inequality were fairly high.ALLISON SCHRAGER is a New York-based economist and writer.Disagree, Confidence Level 7Inequality needn\'t be a big issue if there is sufficient economic mobility.THEDA SKOCPOL is the Victor S. Thomas Professor of Government and Sociology at Harvard University.Agree, Confidence Level 7Rising economic inequality in and of itself does not cause political upheavals--certainly not upheavals that better the situation of the less privileged. The less privileged need some organization to push back effectively. Rising inequality can result in decay, social disorganization, and political apathy. For the United States in particular, I worry that this could be the outcome. Alternatively, there could be upheavals of the xenophobic and nativist variety.SEAN TRENDE is the Senior Elections Analyst for RealClearPolitics.Disagree, Confidence Level 3"The developed world" is fairly broad, and my experience is mostly with U.S. politics, which is one source of my large degree of uncertainty. But the U.S. experience does not demonstrate much of a relationship between inequality and political upheavals: the 1920s, with a relatively high degree of inequality, had fairly stable politics; whereas the 1970s, with relatively low inequality, had, at least by U.S. standards, multiple political upheavals. (Note: if one believes that inequality is likely to end in an economic catastrophe, then this analysis would be different.) The other source of my uncertainty is that, unlike the 1920s, we seem to be in a low-growth stage. If the middle and lower classes don\'t feel relatively good about their prospects, we might have different outcomes than we have had in the past. At the same time, public opinion polling suggests that inequality still commands a low degree of interest from the general public.MICHAEL WALZER is Professor Emeritus of Social Science at the Institute for Advanced Study and Co-Editor ofDissent.Agree, Confidence Level 4I hope for upheavals in the form of social movements pressing for greater equality. But given the strong oligarchic tendencies in our society, and in parts of Europe too, I don\'t have the confidence I would like to have.PETER WEHNER, former Deputy Assistant to the President and Director of the White House Office of Strategic Initiatives, is a Senior Fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.Disagree, Confidence Level 7The problem isn\'t economic (or income) inequality as much as a lack of social mobility. If people feel that the game is rigged and living standards stall or fall, inequality can become convulsive. If not, it\'s far less of a problem, since we know that inequality is part of the human experience. We don\'t resent Tom Brady for making more than Kirk Cousins.MARTIN WOLF is Chief Economics Commentator for theFinancial Times.Agree, Confidence Level 8If wealth is increasingly concentrated in relatively few hands, democracy will cease to be a stable political system. This will be particularly true if the economy ceases to perform well. The wealthy will want to limit the franchise to minimize redistribution of their wealth. They will also seek the support of those whose economic interests clash with their own. This can only be done by a mixture of diversion of anger onto other groups and obfuscation of reality. Promotion of rage as a fundamental political tool will undermine political stability and ultimately lead to antidemocratic populism or antidemocratic plutocracy.HAVE YOUR SAY  Weigh in on the question via our reader poll:powered by&lt;!--//--&gt;&lt;![CDATA[// &gt;&lt;!--// &lt;![CDATA[(function(t,e,n,c){var o,s,a;t.SMCX=t.SMCX||[],e.getElementById(c)||(o=e.getElementsByTagName(n),s=o[o.length-1],a=e.createElement(n),a.type="text/javascript",a.async=!0,a.id=c,a.src=["https:"===location.protocol?"https://":"http://","widget.surveymonkey.com/collect/website/js/pfa1z7VaBCfRx_2FEUQkL2naJqD_2FFUym6DjP8jQmyu8OkDpg759cd85NpSznc1bVn0.js"].join(""),s.parentNode.insertBefore(a,s))})(window,document,"script","smcx-sdk");// ]]]]&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&gt;//--&gt;&lt;!]]&gt;.

S'We stand on the brink of a technological revolution that will fundamentally alter the way we live, work, and relate to one another. In its scale, scope, and complexity, the transformation will be unlike anything humankind has experienced before. We do not yet know just how it will unfold, but one thing is clear: the response to it must be integrated and comprehensive, involving all stakeholders of the global polity, from the public and private sectors to academia and civil society.The First Industrial Revolution used water and steam power to mechanize production. The Second used electric power to create mass production. The Third used electronics and information technology to automate production. Now a Fourth Industrial Revolution is building on the Third, the digital revolution that has been occurring since the middle of the last century. It is characterized by a fusion of technologies that is blurring the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres.There are three reasons why today\'s transformations represent not merely a prolongation of the Third Industrial Revolution but rather the arrival of a Fourth and distinct one: velocity, scope, and systems impact. The speed of current breakthroughs has no historical precedent. When compared with previous industrial revolutions, the Fourth is evolving at an exponential rather than a linear pace. Moreover, it is disrupting almost every industry in every country. And the breadth and depth of these changes herald the transformation of entire systems of production, management, and governance.The possibilities of billions of people connected by mobile devices, with unprecedented processing power, storage capacity, and access to knowledge, are unlimited. And these possibilities will be multiplied by emerging technology breakthroughs in fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, 3-D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, energy storage, and quantum computing.Already, artificial intelligence is all around us, from self-driving cars and drones to virtual assistants and software that translate or invest. Impressive progress has been made in AI in recent years, driven by exponential increases in computing power and by the availability of vast amounts of data, from software used to discover new drugs to algorithms used to predict our cultural interests. Digital fabrication technologies, meanwhile, are interacting with the biological world on a daily basis. Engineers, designers, and architects are combining computational design, additive manufacturing, materials engineering, and synthetic biology to pioneer a symbiosis between microorganisms, our bodies, the products we consume, and even the buildings we inhabit.CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIESLike the revolutions that preceded it, the Fourth Industrial Revolution has the potential to raise global income levels and improve the quality of life for populations around the world. To date, those who have gained the most from it have been consumers able to afford and access the digital world; technology has made possible new products and services that increase the efficiency and pleasure of our personal lives. Ordering a cab, booking a flight, buying a product, making a payment, listening to music, watching a film, or playing a game--any of these can now be done remotely.In the future, technological innovation will also lead to a supply-side miracle, with long-term gains in efficiency and productivity. Transportation and communication costs will drop, logistics and global supply chains will become more effective, and the cost of trade will diminish, all of which will open new markets and drive economic growth.At the same time, as the economists Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee have pointed out, the revolution could yield greater inequality, particularly in its potential to disrupt labor markets. As automation substitutes for labor across the entire economy, the net displacement of workers by machines might exacerbate the gap between returns to capital and returns to labor. On the other hand, it is also possible that the displacement of workers by technology will, in aggregate, result in a net increase in safe and rewarding jobs.We cannot foresee at this point which scenario is likely to emerge, and history suggests that the outcome is likely to be some combination of the two. However, I am convinced of one thing--that in the future, talent, more than capital, will represent the critical factor of production. This will give rise to a job market increasingly segregated into "low-skill/low-pay" and "high-skill/high-pay" segments, which in turn will lead to an increase in social tensions.In addition to being a key economic concern, inequality represents the greatest societal concern associated with the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The largest beneficiaries of innovation tend to be the providers of intellectual and physical capital--the innovators, shareholders, and investors--which explains the rising gap in wealth between those dependent on capital versus labor. Technology is therefore one of the main reasons why incomes have stagnated, or even decreased, for a majority of the population in high-income countries: the demand for highly skilled workers has increased while the demand for workers with less education and lower skills has decreased. The result is a job market with a strong demand at the high and low ends, but a hollowing out of the middle.This helps explain why so many workers are disillusioned and fearful that their own real incomes and those of their children will continue to stagnate. It also helps explain why middle classes around the world are increasingly experiencing a pervasive sense of dissatisfaction and unfairness. A winner-takes-all economy that offers only limited access to the middle class is a recipe for democratic malaise and dereliction.Discontent can also be fueled by the pervasiveness of digital technologies and the dynamics of information sharing typified by social media. More than 30 percent of the global population now uses social media platforms to connect, learn, and share information. In an ideal world, these interactions would provide an opportunity for cross-cultural understanding and cohesion. However, they can also create and propagate unrealistic expectations as to what constitutes success for an individual or a group, as well as offer opportunities for extreme ideas and ideologies to spread.THE IMPACT ON BUSINESSAn underlying theme in my conversations with global CEOs and senior business executives is that the acceleration of innovation and the velocity of disruption are hard to comprehend or anticipate and that these drivers constitute a source of constant surprise, even for the best connected and most well informed. Indeed, across all industries, there is clear evidence that the technologies that underpin the Fourth Industrial Revolution are having a major impact on businesses. On the supply side, many industries are seeing the introduction of new technologies that create entirely new ways of serving existing needs and significantly disrupt existing industry value chains. Disruption is also flowing from agile, innovative competitors who, thanks to access to global digital platforms for research, development, marketing, sales, and distribution, can oust well-established incumbents faster than ever by improving the quality, speed, or price at which value is delivered.Major shifts on the demand side are also occurring, as growing transparency, consumer engagement, and new patterns of consumer behavior (increasingly built upon access to mobile networks and data) force companies to adapt the way they design, market, and deliver products and services.A key trend is the development of technology-enabled platforms that combine both demand and supply to disrupt existing industry structures, such as those we see within the "sharing" or "on demand" economy. These technology platforms, rendered easy to use by the smartphone, convene people, assets, and data--thus creating entirely new ways of consuming goods and services in the process. In addition, they lower the barriers for businesses and individuals to create wealth, altering the personal and professional environments of workers. These new platform businesses are rapidly multiplying into many new services, ranging from laundry to shopping, from chores to parking, from massages to travel.On the whole, there are four main effects that the Fourth Industrial Revolution has on business--on customer expectations, on product enhancement, on collaborative innovation, and on organizational forms. Whether consumers or businesses, customers are increasingly at the epicenter of the economy, which is all about improving how customers are served. Physical products and services, moreover, can now be enhanced with digital capabilities that increase their value. New technologies make assets more durable and resilient, while data and analytics are transforming how they are maintained. A world of customer experiences, data-based services, and asset performance through analytics, meanwhile, requires new forms of collaboration, particularly given the speed at which innovation and disruption are taking place. And the emergence of global platforms and other new business models, finally, means that talent, culture, and organizational forms will have to be rethought.Overall, the inexorable shift from simple digitization (the Third Industrial Revolution) to innovation based on combinations of technologies (the Fourth Industrial Revolution) is forcing companies to reexamine the way they do business. The bottom line, however, is the same: business leaders and senior executives need to understand their changing environment, challenge the assumptions of their operating teams, and relentlessly and continuously innovate.THE IMPACT ON GOVERNMENTAs the physical, digital, and biological worlds continue to converge, new technologies and platforms will increasingly enable citizens to engage with governments, voice their opinions, coordinate their efforts, and even circumvent the supervision of public authorities. Simultaneously, governments will gain new technological powers to increase their control over populations, based on pervasive surveillance systems and the ability to control digital infrastructure. On the whole, however, governments will increasingly face pressure to change their current approach to public engagement and policymaking, as their central role of conducting policy diminishes owing to new sources of competition and the redistribution and decentralization of power that new technologies make possible.Ultimately, the ability of government systems and public authorities to adapt will determine their survival. If they prove capable of embracing a world of disruptive change, subjecting their structures to the levels of transparency and efficiency that will enable them to maintain their competitive edge, they will endure. If they cannot evolve, they will face increasing trouble.This will be particularly true in the realm of regulation. Current systems of public policy and decision-making evolved alongside the Second Industrial Revolution, when decision-makers had time to study a specific issue and develop the necessary response or appropriate regulatory framework. The whole process was designed to be linear and mechanistic, following a strict "top down" approach.But such an approach is no longer feasible. Given the Fourth Industrial Revolution\'s rapid pace of change and broad impacts, legislators and regulators are being challenged to an unprecedented degree and for the most part are proving unable to cope.How, then, can they preserve the interest of the consumers and the public at large while continuing to support innovation and technological development? By embracing "agile" governance, just as the private sector has increasingly adopted agile responses to software development and business operations more generally. This means regulators must continuously adapt to a new, fast-changing environment, reinventing themselves so they can truly understand what it is they are regulating. To do so, governments and regulatory agencies will need to collaborate closely with business and civil society.The Fourth Industrial Revolution will also profoundly impact the nature of national and international security, affecting both the probability and the nature of conflict. The history of warfare and internationalsecurity is the history of technological innovation, and today is no exception. Modern conflicts involving states are increasingly "hybrid" in nature, combining traditional battlefield techniques with elements previously associated with nonstate actors. The distinction between war and peace, combatant and noncombatant, and even violence and nonviolence (think cyberwarfare) is becoming uncomfortably blurry.As this process takes place and new technologies such as autonomous or biological weapons become easier to use, individuals and small groups will increasingly join states in being capable of causing mass harm. This new vulnerability will lead to new fears. But at the same time, advances in technology will create the potential to reduce the scale or impact of violence, through the development of new modes of protection, for example, or greater precision in targeting.THE IMPACT ON PEOPLEThe Fourth Industrial Revolution, finally, will change not only what we do but also who we are. It will affect our identity and all the issues associated with it: our sense of privacy, our notions of ownership, our consumption patterns, the time we devote to work and leisure, and how we develop our careers, cultivate our skills, meet people, and nurture relationships. It is already changing our health and leading to a "quantified" self, and sooner than we think it may lead to human augmentation. The list is endless because it is bound only by our imagination.I am a great enthusiast and early adopter of technology, but sometimes I wonder whether the inexorable integration of technology in our lives could diminish some of our quintessential human capacities, such as compassion and cooperation. Our relationship with our smartphones is a case in point. Constant connection may deprive us of one of life\'s most important assets: the time to pause, reflect, and engage in meaningful conversation.One of the greatest individual challenges posed by new information technologies is privacy. We instinctively understand why it is so essential, yet the tracking and sharing of information about us is a crucial part of the new connectivity. Debates about fundamental issues such as the impact on our inner lives of the loss of control over our data will only intensify in the years ahead. Similarly, the revolutions occurring in biotechnology and AI, which are redefining what it means to be human by pushing back the current thresholds of life span, health, cognition, and capabilities, will compel us to redefine our moral and ethical boundaries.SHAPING THE FUTURE  Neither technology nor the disruption that comes with it is an exogenous force over which humans have no control. All of us are responsible for guiding its evolution, in the decisions we make on a daily basis as citizens, consumers, and investors. We should thus grasp the opportunity and power we have to shape the Fourth Industrial Revolution and direct it toward a future that reflects our common objectives and values.To do this, however, we must develop a comprehensive and globally shared view of how technology is affecting our lives and reshaping our economic, social, cultural, and human environments. There has never been a time of greater promise, or one of greater potential peril. Today\'s decision-makers, however, are too often trapped in traditional, linear thinking, or too absorbed by the multiple crises demanding their attention, to think strategically about the forces of disruption and innovation shaping our future.In the end, it all comes down to people and values. We need to shape a future that works for all of us by putting people first and empowering them. In its most pessimistic, dehumanized form, the Fourth Industrial Revolution may indeed have the potential to "robotize" humanity and thus to deprive us of our heart and soul. But as a complement to the best parts of human nature--creativity, empathy, stewardship--it can also lift humanity into a new collective and moral consciousness based on a shared sense of destiny. It is incumbent on us all to make sure the latter prevails. '

S'Cockett, a former correspondent for The Economist, has traveled to every corner of Myanmar (also known as Burma) to uncover the roots of its troubled condition. The Burmans, the majority ethnic group (who are mostly Buddhist), live on the country\'s central plain. They are surrounded by a horseshoe-shaped ring of "hill tribes," many of which are Christian and which are classified into 135 officially recognized ethnic groups. This picture is further complicated by the legacies of the British colonial period, when the country experienced an influx of Hindus and Muslims from various parts of India, as well as Chinese merchants, Iraqi Jews, and others seeking commercial opportunities. Faced with so much ethnic and religious diversity, postindependence military regimes tried to "purify" the country through assimilationist education and language policies, exclusionary citizenship laws, and a military-dominated economic model, all of which have only exacerbated divisions. Cockett\'s lucid analysis of these complexities makes clear his affection for the country. But he evinces little hope that the current quasi-military regime or the opposition can overcome these conflicts and make Myanmar anything more than a "stunted democracy." blank'

S'Karachi is one of the world\'s most violent cities, beset by strikes, riots, bombings, arsons, murders, massacres, and mutilations carried out by a staggering array of actors, including student and labor movements, political parties, criminal gangs, sectarian extremists, and the Pakistani Taliban. Sporadic attempts by government forces to reclaim control have only intensified the violence. But Gayer patiently uncovers the latent patterns of order that allow the city to function and to produce one-quarter of Pakistan\'s GDPand handle 95 percent of its foreign trade. Violence often takes place within factions that are disciplining their own dissidents or represents a phase of negotiations among rival parties--negotiations that also include episodes of cooperation. Communities segregate themselves, and people learn to interpret street scenes to avoid trouble. The abundance of interest groups and conflicts makes the story sometimes hard to follow, but the larger message is clear: the sheer number of violent organizations and the tenuous balance of power among them--what the author calls "armed consociationalism"--prevents the city from spinning out of control. Gayer\'s own evidence, however, shows that the situation is steadily getting worse. blank'

S'As many as a third of Iranian adults may be affiliated with the Basij, a hard-line paramilitary group whose name translates as "mobilization." The group formed during the Iran-Iraq War, and its purpose is to protect the Islamic Republic and its supreme leader. Resources began to flow in its direction especially after the reformist Mohammad Khatami won the presidency in 1997. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who succeeded Khatami, was drawn from the Basij, and its members brutally defended his 2009 reelection, attacking the so-called Green Movement demonstrators who protested the election\'s outcome. In Golkar\'s skillful rendering, the Basij appears so vast that all Iranians can find some facet of themselves reflected in it. That said, its members hail primarily from the lower-middle classes and from rural areas. Its ranks include five million women and girls, nearly a million students, most of Iran\'s regular police officers, and around 60 percent of all the civil servants in Iran. Belonging to the Basij often means enjoying access to jobs, cheap loans and housing, entrance to a university, and professional promotions. But the group is more feared than respected, and Golkar views it as a major impediment to any liberalization or democratization in the Islamic Republic. blank'

S"This very readable history provides an excellent introduction to Africa's most populous country. It begins with a look at British colonial rule, which established sharp economic, cultural, and political divisions in Nigeria, most dramatically between its northern and southern halves. These tensions undermined any sense of national unity and were exacerbated by the emergence of competitive politics after World War II and, eventually, independence, which came in 1960. Bourne expertly walks the reader through the political deterioration that led to the Nigerian Civil War, which raged from 1967 until 1970 and ended with the defeat of separatists from the southern state of Biafra. He then covers the subsequent decades of military rule and the slow and inconsistent democratization that began in 2000 and culminated in last year's remarkably peaceful election and transition of power, which resulted in Muhammadu Buhari's presidency. An admirably succinct final chapter ties together several themes, including the negative effects of oil dependence; the egregious corruption within the Nigerian elite, which continues to hinder democratic rule and economic growth; and the evolving role of religion as a source of political and social cleavages. blank"

S"Ivan Maisky was an amazing diplomat by anyone's standards, and it turns out that he was an amazing diarist as well. In the Soviet bureaucracy, Maisky stood out in many ways, especially as a Jew, and also as someone who was comparatively open-minded but nonetheless loyal and who survived Stalin's purges--one of only two major Soviet ambassadors to do so. (Two weeks before Stalin died, in 1953, Maisky was arrested during the anti-Jewish witch-hunt that marked the dictator's last years, but he was released two years later and fully rehabilitated.) During the 11 years he spent as a Soviet diplomat in London, Maisky kept a daily diary, a bold act in itself. Gorodetsky stumbled across it in 1993 while doing some research in Moscow. Almost every page sparkles with Maisky's urbane wit. His portraits of the British elite are stunningly acute, and his depiction of London's social, cultural, and political life radiates with color and a refined sensibility--especially the passages recorded during the German air siege of 1940. The diaries give readers a chance to meet a significant figure from this period who eschewed leaden Soviet-speak and candidly shared his doubts, convictions, fears, hopes, and frailties with honesty and clarity. blank"

S"Hung masterfully integrates wide-ranging historical and economic details to make sense of China's development and relations with the global economy. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Chinese leader Mao Zedong unwittingly laid the basis for Chinese capitalism by carrying out forced industrialization on the backs of the peasants. His successors pursued a version of the classic East Asian state-led capitalist model by fostering the development of export-dependent coastal urban economies and massive state enterprises while tolerating relative stagnation in the rural hinterlands. That strategy generated rapid economic growth but also corrupt and repressive local governance, an overreliance on exports, overinvestment in infrastructure, and an explosion of debt. Hung argues, controversially but convincingly, that there is no unique China model that developing countries can follow in order to avoid the flaws of capitalism or close the wealth gap with the developed world. Moreover, the boom of the book's title is destined to peter out, potentially with disastrous consequences, unless the regime cedes more economic and political power to peasants and workers. Meanwhile, China has integrated its interests so tightly with those of the United States that its rise supports, rather than threatens, the U.S.-led global order. blank"

The entries range from the obvious (Chinese President Xi Jinping, the dissident Wei Jingsheng) to the surprising (Wang Shuo, a transgressive novelist; Jet Li, the martial arts movie star; Rebiya Kadeer, the exiled Uighur advocate; Lai Changxing, the smuggling kingpin) and include leaders in politics, business, science, sports, and the arts. Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan are also represented (by, among others, former Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui, the pop singer Teresa Teng, the movie director Wong Kar-wai, and the gambling czar Stanley Ho). Some important names are inevitably omitted--for example, the dissident artist Ai Weiwei. The entries are not merely life chronologies. They probe their subjects' personalities and accomplishments, providing a sense of how each subject fits into the complex mosaic of Chinese society.

S'One warm morning in October, a usually crowded junction in South Delhi was completely jammed. Close to 100 Indian women, at various stages of pregnancy, took to the streets to rally against the Indian government\'s proposal a few days earlier to ban foreign couples from hiring Indian surrogates. Those protesting were surrogate mothers seeking to protect their livelihoods.Although there is no official estimate of how many surrogates there are in India, let alone the number of surrogates for foreign couples, it is an estimated $400 million industry and growing at roughly 20 percent a year. Women who carry children for Indian couples make anywhere from 80,000 to 200,000 rupees ($1,198 to $2,995), whereas those who work for foreign couples can earn up to 500,000 rupees ($7,488).Susheela, 28, whose last name has been withheld to protect her identity, is working as a surrogate for the second time. She has carried children for foreign couples on both occasions. Protesting outside the office of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), a regulatory body that has been entrusted with the responsibility of framing surrogacy laws in the country, Susheela looked determined. "I carried the child of an Australian couple five years ago," she said. "Now, I am carrying this child for a German couple. And, I have not been denied payment or kept in bad conditions or been ill-treated."  Mansi Thapliyal / ReutersSurrogate mothers rest inside a temporary home for surrogates, Ahmedabad, India, August 24, 2013.Her words bear a striking contrast to the public interest litigation filed by lawyer Jayashree Wad in India\'s Supreme Court, which claims that Indian surrogates from poor and lower-middle-class households are exploited, especially by foreign couples. Stories of abuse include foreign parents neglecting to pay the surrogate or abandoning the newborn after learning of birth defects, creating, in effect, "stateless" children.SURROGACY TOURISM BOOMIndia\'s first surrogacy case took place in 1978 when a woman in Calcutta agreed to carry a child for her daughter, who was incapable of bearing one. In the early 2000s, India became a favored destination for commercial surrogacy, a process that involves implanting a lab-developed embryo in the surrogate\'s womb. The trend was driven by the availability of excellent medical facilities for extremely low prices and the fact that the procedure was not banned there as it was in many Western countries such as France, Germany, and Spain.In India, the industry remains unregulated, barring a few guidelines drawn up by the ICMR. The recommendations include the provision of psychological assistance to the surrogates and steps that a fertility clinic needs to take in order to register a surrogacy. These guidelines have now been incorporated into a legally enforceable contract, which the surrogate signs with the commissioning parents in the presence of medical professionals.Yet this document is no insurance against exploitation of a surrogate, especially if she comes from a less privileged background, according to Ranjana Kumari, director of the Centre for Social Research in India. Many surrogates are illiterate and do not understand the terms of the agreement, she says. Susheela, for example, who worked for a posh South Delhi clinic, signed her contracts in English but says she understood little of it since she can read and write in Hindi, her native language.Still, Kumari believes that banning foreign couples from hiring Indian surrogates will not solve the problem of poor regulation. "A ban will only help in the flourishing of a black market," she says. "When you try to make anything illegal, it will only find back channels."    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display("dfp-ad-x90_2");    });  Gita Aravamudan, the author of the 2014 book Baby Makers: The Story of Indian Surrogacy, agrees. Although she has heard of Indian women complaining that they fell ill after being injected with too many hormones, the issue is not to ban surrogacy but to offer better oversight of the practice. "The way out of that is to ensure that the contracts that they sign are enforced," she says. "Not banning foreign couples who pay more than Indian commissioning parents." In the United Kingdom, for example, commercial surrogacy is banned but is allowed if done on a voluntary basis. In fact, says Aravamudan, "People tell me that a lot of money is paid under the table. Corruption doesn\'t happen only in India. It happens everywhere."Also, to protect against child abandonment, Indian law now requires foreign couples to get a DNA test on the child and have at least one of the parents\' DNA match. "This helps us know that at least one of the parents has a stake in the child; the chances of the child being cared for are higher," says Aravamudan.This precautionary step is absent when it comes to Indian commissioning parents. Observers, including Aravamudan, believe that the absence of this step raises the potential for abuse among Indian couples.For example, on the condition of anonymity, one doctor at a fertility clinic in Mumbai told me that in 2010, one clinic accidentally implanted the wrong embryo inside the surrogate. The mistake was not discovered until after the baby was four months old. When the couple found out that the baby was genetically not theirs, they abandoned it.ALL PARTIES CONSIDEREDFraming laws on surrogacy is no easy task because it involves adding new definitions to existing laws and making sure all parties involved--the genetic parents, the surrogate, and even the child--receive protections. No country in the world has a legal framework for commercial surrogacy. If India manages to legally regulate commercial surrogacy, it will be the first.At the moment, India is pioneering a draft surrogacy law, called the 2014 Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Bill, and it is pending discussion in the Indian Parliament for the summer of 2016. It has been revised three times since its introduction in 2008, and it seeks to ensure better living and medical conditions for the surrogates, among other things."Most existing laws in India are inconsistent with the needs of surrogacy," says Hari Ramasubramanian, chief consultant at the Indian Surrogacy Law Centre. For instance, he says, minute details such as the legal definition of a "mother" would need to be altered to specify that biological mothers and legal mothers need not always be the same. Therefore, passing a law on surrogacy requires changing existing laws on parenthood.Also, there are many participants in this industry whose rights are even trickier--for instance, the rights of the surrogate child. "The child has not asked to be born," says Aravamudan. "Therefore, its rights are something that needs to be taken into account. For instance, in India the eggs need not be of the woman who commissions the baby. If the child wants to find out its biological origins after many years, there is no way it will be able to given the current guidelines."  Mansi Thapliyal / ReutersMadhu Makwana (2nd L), 35, who is a first time surrogate mother, attends her baby shower ceremony, Ahmedabad, India, August 22, 2013.Since surrogacy is a maze of complex legal and ethical issues, Ramasubramanian feels that it should be decided on a case-by-case basis. "The right to have a child should be decided based on whether the couple can be good parents," he explains. "We should ensure the children are not being given to pedophiles or drug addicts, etc. It should not be decided by citizenship." The ICMR denied an interview request, claiming that the case was due for hearing in the Supreme Court and that they did not want to comment until a judgment was handed down.FOR DIGNITYFor her part, Susheela is from a small village in western Uttar Pradesh. After being married at the age of 16, she had to stay behind in the village when her husband went to Delhi to support them both. After four years of hard labor as a construction worker, he finally saved up enough to rent a small shanty in Delhi for the two of them. A few months later, a man approached her, explaining that he was "an agent" for a fertility clinic in Delhi.At first, Susheela, not understanding the science behind surrogacy, expressed shock at the idea of carrying someone else\'s child. However, when the doctors at the fertility clinic explained to her that she would not have to engage in sexual intercourse, she realized that it was an incredible and lucrative opportunity for her.  "What my husband earned in four years, I managed to earn in the one year that I carried a child for the Australian couple," says Susheela. She was paid 120,000 rupees ($1,797) when she delivered the child. There are other perks as well. Susheela was given paid vacation time in a surrogate home, a specially designed residence that belongs to the fertility clinic to ensure that the women are well-fed and cared for. At the surrogate home, Susheela received hot meals and could sleep as much as she wished to. When she carried her own child, she had to wash dishes in a local restaurant over a mile away from her house. "Even when I was seven months pregnant with my child, I was washing the dishes for about seven hours a day," she says.A number of women like Susheela have also benefited a great deal by working as surrogates. Bina Bai, from Darbhanga in the state of Bihar, was also protesting along with Susheela. She is a first-time surrogate and says she is enjoying the process. She receives hot meals three times a day and will receive 200,000 rupees ($2,995) after she delivers the child in three months. That is equivalent to almost three years of harsh agricultural labor back in Bihar.Like these women, Susheela feels that the surrogacy industry should flourish, even though she might never be a surrogate again. The rule allows a woman to be a surrogate only twice in her childbearing years. "I didn\'t have to sleep with any man to make that money," she says, alluding to India\'s growing prostitution industry. "I got it in a dignified manner. That is all I care about." '

S'Byman structures this primer on jihadism around a series of "frequently asked questions." But don\'t be deceived: there is plenty of useful information and solid analysis packed into this simple text. Byman stresses the massive unpopularity of the United States among the world\'s 1.6 billion Muslims and reviews the tools available to Washington for containing, if not defeating, jihadist networks. He focuses mainly on al Qaeda and its affiliates, devoting only one chapter to the Islamic State (also known as ISIS), which formed as a direct outgrowth of al Qaeda\'s branch in Iraq. Jihadists of all stripes seek the restoration of the caliphate, but al Qaeda believes that ISISjumped the gun in proclaiming its establishment in 2014. He argues that the core al Qaeda organization is not a spent force, and that Ayman al-Zawahiri, its current leader, is an effective successor to Osama bin Laden. Today, the group\'s affiliates are more dynamic than the mothership; indeed, in some ways, the branches prop up the base. Despite the group\'s loss of safe havens and the U.S. campaign of drone strikes against its leaders (of which Byman approves), al Qaeda has plenty of life left in it. blank'

S"Like most other informed observers, Atwan takes the threat posed by the Islamic State, or ISIS, very seriously. It is a highly sophisticated movement that exerts control over some six million people, boasts around 200,000 armed fighters, and last year sold around 80,000 barrels of oil every day, on average. Atwan oscillates between attributing ISIS' emergence to the historical and recent blunders of Western powers and ascribing it to the poor judgment of local authorities,such as former Iraqi President Nouri al-Maliki. Atwan emphasizes that even many Muslims who could become victims of ISIS' violence feel a grudging sympathy for the group. He also shows how through its mastery of digital communications, ISIShas mobilized Muslim youths all over the world. Atwan agrees with many other experts who see Saudi Arabia as the major source of support for jihadist movements; the irony is that from ISIS' perspective, no prize could be greater than capturing the Saudi kingdom. Atwan argues that ISISwill not be defeated by a campaign of drones strikes and aerial bombardment but that putting Western boots on the ground would play right into the group's hands. blank"

S"Chen is the blind human rights activist whose dramatic 2012 escape from house arrest to refuge in the U.S. embassy in Beijing led to tense negotiations over his fate between U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Chinese authorities and then to Chen's exile in the United States. His stubborn resistance to in-justices in rural China--especially the government's coercive enforcement of the one-child policy--led him and his family to be targeted by local Communist Party officials with detentions, beatings, a sham trial, imprisonment, and extralegal house arrest, to the point where his mistreatment became an international scandal. The book culminates in the gripping story of his nighttime escape from his village, right under the noses of dozens of guards. Chen is an outsize personality, but he comes from an ordinary village, so his memoir provides insight into the factors that make relations between local officials and peasants so explosive throughout China. It also illuminates some of the ways in which foreign pressure can help ameliorate human rights abuses, even in this era of Chinese assertiveness. blank"

S"This sprawling collection of essays is the first book-length English-language study of the Central African Republic. Such neglect is predictable given that the landlocked CARis desperately poor and boasts virtually no natural resources. But the CAR's history of failed state building, instability, and civil violence, which has led to a succession of international peacekeeping interventions since the mid-1990s, is very much worth examining. A sharp essay by Stephen Smith places the current instability in historical context. Greedy national elites have always preferred to appropriate public resources for their private use rather than grow the national economy or govern effectively. Today, they view international peacekeeping efforts as merely another trough at which to feed. Yet the book's chapters on the international community's woefully inadequate interventions also help explain the lack of local buy-in. The need for more effective international engagement is obvious, but the book is frustratingly silent on what better interventions might look like. blank"

S'Ethiopia has enjoyed double-digit economic growth rates for the last decade, establishing itself as the fastest-growing economy in Africa. As a senior official in the ruling regime for the last few decades, Oqubay has been one of the architects of its economic policy, and his book offers interesting insights into the leadership\'s ideas and motivations, especially when it comes to industry and exports. However, most of Ethiopia\'s recent growth has come in the agricultural and service sectors, and so Oqubay\'s argument that industrialization represents the key to economic success seems misplaced and mostly aspirational. Oqubay wants Ethiopia to adopt a development model heavily influenced by East Asian countries such as South Korea, where governments have been able to stimulate growth by exerting tight control over the economy. He repeatedly criticizes what he calls "mainstream" economics for its emphasis on comparative advantage and market-based incentives, insisting instead on the benefits of top-down planning. At the core of his analysis are well-informed case studies of Ethiopia\'s cement, floriculture, and leather industries, in which he offers surprisingly frank assessments of the managerial and economic constraints these subsectors face. blank'

S'In late 2007, a contested presidential election in Kenya resulted in widespread violence, leading to 1,300 deaths and rendering homeless hundreds of thousands of Kenyans. The fighting made headlines, but it was not particularly novel: since 1990, more than half the multiparty elections held in sub-Saharan Africa have resulted in violence. Burchard examines the Kenyan case, along with episodes in Liberia and Senegal. In all three countries, pro-government and opposition groups both took part in the violence, but state forces were more likely to do so in a premeditated, strategic manner. Burchard shows that when elections are followed by chaos and bloodshed, it negatively affects turnout the next time around and serves to undermine public support for democracy. Burchard notes that postelection violence is far less common in a handful of democratic countries in the region that have relatively strong and independent democratic institutions, such as news media, electoral commissions, and judiciaries. blank'

S'In dealing with North Korea, Japanese policymakers focus as much on what they call "the abductee issue" as on the issue of nuclear weapons. In the 1970s and 1980s, North Korean agents seized an unknown number--perhaps hundreds--of Japanese citizens from beaches and city streets, smuggling them to North Korea to serve as language instructors, potential spies, and in other roles that apparently were not well thought out. Some may have been killed so that their identities could be assumed by North Korean agents. Boynton vividly describes the bizarre experiences of some of the victims, who were forced to feign loyalty to the North Korean system--and in some cases actually came to support the regime of Kim Il Sung. So far, Pyongyang has allowed five abductees to return to Japan with their children and has identified eight who it claims have died of natural causes. This accounting has done little to satisfy Japanese public opinion, which is anxious about Japan\'s vulnerability to its neighbor\'s unpredictable acts. For its part, North Korea points out that during World War II, Japan abducted a far greater number of Korean citizens to serve in mines, on farms, and in factories, and many of them died or remain unaccounted for. blank'

S'Edwards plunges into the cultural lives of Cairo, Casablanca, and Tehran to illustrate the demise of one aspect of "the American century": the outsize influence that U.S. popular culture exercised in the Middle East. He explores, among other things, Egyptian literature and political cartoons, Moroccan films and writings that deal with sexuality, the 2011 Iranian film A Separation, and the 2012 U.S. film Argo. Edwards\' wanderings produce many insights and readable treatments of a number of Middle Eastern texts and films. One persistent and problematic message risks undermining his efforts, however: in the Middle East, he writes, U.S. cultural products are so thoroughly recast in local vernaculars that they are rendered "untranslatable." Edwards does not tell the reader much about those transformations because, it seems, any attempt to do so would be futile or distorting. That leaves the reader struggling to comprehend what, exactly, has replaced American popular culture. One unfortunate omission is the lack of any reference to Bassem Youssef, the satirist often referred to as "the Jon Stewart of Egypt," whose wit is not lost in translation. blank'

Cheterian deals with the most familiar aspects of the controversy: the insistence of Armenia and the Armenian diaspora that Turkey recognize the killing as genocide and the refusal of Turkish governments over the years not only to accept that designation but even to acknowledge the scale and nature of what happened. Cheterian also explores the killings' intricate legacy in the Armenian communities that remain in Turkey and in others scattered across the world, revealing how the fight over 1915 continues to shape conflicts in Armenia, Azerbaijan, and the Middle East--and debates in the U.S. Congress. On an encouraging note, he reports that some among the younger generation of Turks are genuinely struggling to understand and come to terms with this episode in Turkish history. blank"

S"This skillful study shows that, in several ways, China's brief, ill-fated invasion of Vietnam in 1979 was more significant than scholars have generally understood. It was the prelude to over a decade of low-level military conflict that lasted until 1991, sapping Vietnam's ability to dominate Cambodia and Thailand. It positioned China firmly in the U.S. camp in the Cold War, cutting off Moscow's opportunity to make itself a Southeast Asian power. Especially valuable is the book's detailed account of the Chinese military's logistical weaknesses, tactical errors, and command incompetence during the invasion. This poor performance enabled Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping to unite the Chinese Communist Party around his strategy of economic development first and military modernization second, with the latter to include streamlining and a shift away from traditional close-combat ground warfare tactics and toward higher-tech combined-arms operations. The month-long initial incursion also did great damage to Vietnam, which the Vietnamese have not forgotten. Chinese-Vietnamese relations may warm and cool, but this book reminds readers of the reasons why fundamental distrust persists on both sides. blank"

S"Military analysts and historians have long held that variations in political systems can affect military effectiveness. For example, authoritarian systems tend to be bolder than democracies; for that reason, authoritarian leaders are more prone to strategic error. In line with other scholars who have recently examined this issue, Talmadge distinguishes between authoritarians who are able to focus unremittingly on the enemy and those who must watch their backs at home. If political leaders are fearful of military coups, they tend to interfere with command structures to prevent the rise of charismatic and ambitious generals. The resulting disruption and uncertainty undermine military performance, especially during complex operations. Talmadge backs up her compelling thesis with well-chosen, interesting case studies. During the Iran-Iraq War, she explains, regimes in both countries worried about coups. Iraq's Saddam Hussein was simply paranoid by nature; Iranian leaders feared that the military still housed loyalists to the shah, whom they had only recently overthrown. Both countries' armies performed better when political leaders put aside such concerns and concentrated on the war. blank"

S"Ten years after Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans--the most culturally distinct city in the United States--is still struggling with the storm's consequences. Rivlin offers a survey of the long, slow recovery. His account suffers from the absence of an analytic overview of New Orleans' economic structures and prospects before and after Katrina. Nevertheless, a clear and somewhat disturbing picture of the initial recovery does emerge. Government at all levels proved ineffective, and local government was hopelessly corrupt. The wealthy, mostly white business interests that had long dominated New Orleans achieved most, but not all, of their goals. The African American majority, mostly poor but also containing a strong middle class, suffered disproportionately but organized effectively enough to prevent the outcomes it feared most. The foundations, urban planners, and upper-middle-class reformers who flocked to the city spent large sums of money but, Rivlin argues, had relatively little impact. Divided, disorganized, and still desperately poor after the storm, New Orleans seems once again to have successfully frustrated the efforts of outsiders to reform or reconstruct it. blank"

S"Anyone reading the news in recent years could be forgiven for reaching the conclusion that the world is in terrible shape and only getting worse. Radelet challenges this perception, at least as far as economic development and democratization are concerned. He reckons that the past quarter century has seen the greatest advances in material well-being in the history of mankind, whether measured in terms of real income, infant mortality, devastation from disease, or a host of other indicators. During the same period, democratic governance has made significant advances all over the world, and Radelet believes the two trends are related. Between 1993 and 2011, some 955 million people rose out of extreme poverty, as defined by the World Bank. Admittedly, China's tremendous economic boom accounted for 60 percent of those. Still, that means that close to 400 million people escaped destitution elsewhere. Radelet does not want anyone to become complacent; there is still much poverty to be eliminated. But he wants to acknowledge, build on, and learn from the substantial successes that have been achieved. Challenges lie ahead, especially in the form of civil conflicts over scarce resources and risks posed by climate change. Radelet, however, believes that good political leadership and international cooperation can overcome such obstacles to further prosperity. blank"

S'After the mid-November terrorist attacks in Paris and the December mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, there has been growing momentum to clamp down on travel and immigration to the United States, in the hope that tougher measures might prevent any further violence. In its less extreme versions, the impulse is understandable, but Congress and the Obama administration need to tread carefully. Openness is the foundation of American economic strength and its diplomatic influence, and each step in the other direction should be taken with an awareness of the true costs.This dilemma is not a new one. It even predates 9/11. In 1998, a Pentagon-chartered commission led by former Senator Gary Hart (D-CO) and former Congressman Warren Rudman (R-NH) warned that the very source of U.S. prosperity and global leadership--its openness to goods, ideas, and people moving across borders--also left the country vulnerable to terrorist attacks. Although Washington has done much in the last 15 years to reduce these vulnerabilities, the dilemma remains.Consider the current congressional effort to reduce the number of refugees the United States admits from Syria, large chunks of which the Islamic State (ISIS) controls. The United States has accepted just over 2,000 Syrian refugees since the civil war began there, a fraction of the tens of thousands that have poured into Europe. In September, U.S. President Barack Obama announced plans to admit another 10,000 Syrian refugees in 2016.  U.S. Customs and Border Protection Handout / Reuters The San Bernardino attackers, Tashfeen Malik, (L), and Syed Farook are pictured passing through Chicago\'s O\'Hare International Airport in this July 27, 2014 handout photo obtained by Reuters, December 8, 2015.In response, most of the Republican presidential candidates have called for a ban on all Syrian and Iraqi refugees. Likewise, dozens of governors have said they would no longer welcome Syrian refugees in their states. And the House of Representatives last month passed legislation that would require the director of the FBI and other senior security officials to personally guarantee that any new refugee from Syria or Iraq does not pose a threat, which would effectively kill the program.The additional restrictions on the table are enormously short-sighted. Apart from the United States\' humanitarian obligations, refugees have long been a source of strength for the country. The more than 125,000 refugees accepted by the United States from Southeast Asia in the late 1970s serve as an example; today there are some 1.3 million Vietnamese immigrants, and their average income exceeds that of native-born Americans. The large diaspora community has helped in rebuilding economic and political relations between the United States and Vietnam, such that Vietnam is now one of the founding members of the recently concluded Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal.U.S. relations with the Middle East might similarly be helped by a more welcoming attitude toward those fleeing the extremism that Americans rightly fear. In an open letter to Congress earlier this month, nearly two dozen of the nation\'s top former defense and homeland security officials from both parties warned that barring refugees would "undermine our core objective of combatting terrorism," whereas a more generous resettlement program would "advance U.S. national security interests by supporting the stability of our allies and partners that are struggling to host large numbers of refugees."The only sensible response is to take cautious steps to improve security with full awareness of the potential consequences. Although greater openness would be a boon to the United States\' economy and foreign policy, it is impossible to say with absolute certainty that no refugee could ever do harm to the United States. Although security review procedures for refugees are already extremely stringent--in fact, they are the most rigorous for any immigrant group to the United States and include years of interviews, biometric checks, and background investigations--even the best checks are only as good as the information available. Tashfeen Malik, the Pakistani-born woman who helped murder 14 innocent civilians in San Bernardino, came to the United States on a K-1 fiancee visa, a heavily scrutinized visa category because of the risk of marriage fraud. But there appears to have been nothing in her record that raised any red flags. This lack of information is a particular problem for migrants from places like Syria, where the United States has limited access and no information-sharing with the government. As FBI director James Comey put it: "If someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or their interest reflected in our database, we can query our database until the cows come home," but "nothing will show up because we have no record on that person."There are also questions about whether the United States should continue permitting visa-free travel from Europe to the United States. The so-called Visa Waiver Program (VWP), signed into law by U.S. President Ronald Reagan in 1986, has been a boon to transatlantic travel and to the U.S. tourism industry. Some 60 percent of all overseas travelers come from the VWP countries, adding nearly $200 billion to the U.S. economy each year. The program also sends a powerful diplomatic signal that the United States trusts its allies by not requiring their citizens to endure long lines at U.S. embassies and consulates waiting to be interviewed. The refusal of the United States to admit Poland to the VWP, for example, has been a major source of friction in the relationship for several years.  Fabrizio Bensch / ReutersChildren watch as they stand on beds in a shelter for migrants inside a hangar of the former Tempelhof airport in Berlin, Germany, December 9, 2015.Yet the VWP does come with certain risks. As Paris again demonstrated, there is a dangerous degree of disaffection among some young second- and third-generation immigrants to Europe--citizens holding Belgian, British, French, and other European passports. The United States and Europe cooperate closely to try to track threats, and the information-sharing requirements of the VWP make it more likely that dangerous individuals will be identified and stopped. All travelers must also identify themselves in advance to the U.S. government through the online Electronic System for Travel Authorization, and are checked carefully against terrorist and criminal watch lists. As with the refugee program, however, there is no certainty that a terrorist could not somehow exploit the program to reach the United States.  The only sensible response is to take cautious steps to improve security with full awareness of the potential consequences. After 9/11, for example, Congress threatened to shut down the foreign student program because several of the hijackers had come to the United States on student visas. Cooler heads fortunately prevailed, but the effort to beef up security screening of foreign students nonetheless led to a significant drop off in foreign student enrollment for several years. Over time, the government has developed better procedures for vetting and monitoring foreign students, although they remain far from perfect. And last year, foreign student enrollment rose at the fastest pace since 1978, demonstrating that security and openness are both possible.There are signs that at least some in Congress recognize the risks of overreacting. This week, the House passed a new visa waiver bill that would make some sensible fixes to the program--such as authorizing the administration to suspend any country that fails to share terror intelligence and traveler data fully with the United States, and speeding up the introduction of electronic passports. It is supported by the Obama administration, but it will still anger European allies because it will require any of their citizens who have travelled to Syria and Iraq, whatever the purpose, to apply for a visa before visiting the United States. The alternative--a Senate bill introduced by Senators Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.)--would have effectively killed the whole program by requiring all travelers to submit biometric identifiers (a fingerprint and a photograph) to the U.S. government before travelling. Likewise, many of those who supported the original House ban on Syrian and Iraqi refugees are now having second thoughts, calling for more targeted measures that would address some of the risks without closing the door entirely.There is no right answer to the "openness vs. security" dilemma and sometimes trade-offs are unavoidable. But recognizing that each matters greatly to the safety, prosperity, and influence of the United States is the first step to crafting intelligent policy responses. '

S'In political conversations, Somalia has become shorthand for how the lack of a strong central government makes states collapse into unlivable chaos. In part, that idea rests on popular conceptions of Somalia as the world\'s most persistent failed state, a nation without basic security where the population struggles to get education, food, and security.The idea that Somalia is completely lacking in central government is false, but the federal government\'s reach is indeed inconsistent. The central government is strongest around the capital, Mogadishu, but declines quickly outside of the immediate area. But that is not to say that no governing structures exist, even if they are not central. Regional governments in Somalia operate with varying degrees of independence and effectiveness, ranging from the almost fully autonomous Somaliland region (which has sought recognition as independent state), areas dominated by the militant organization al Shabab, and other states and regions that still struggle to establish political control.This patchwork quilt of governmental systems forms the backdrop of Somali life. It is true that the country offers lessons in the dangers associated with a lack of central government. It also shows how people respond to collective problems without government, too. In many parts of the country, society has organized itself to effectively solve collective problems and provide public goods. Somalia\'s nearly ten and a half million residents maintain daily routines not too dissimilar to those in more developed countries. Basic utilities and services, such as garbage removal and clean water access, are offered by private-sector firms and small local governments fulfilling the jobs normally left to the state. One example is the energy sector in Somalia. A report by the Shuraako program of One Earth Future documented the current structure of electricity provision in Somalia, where electricity has been provided largely by a network of small independent producers. This has resulted in increasing access to electricity across the country but also high prices and inconsistent provision.In other words, in Somalia, a lack of government has not led to a lack of governance: when considering many issues of public goods and collective problems, Somali society has been able to step into gaps left by the absence of state institutions. This is particularly true at the local and municipal level: Davidson College Professor Ken Menkhaus has argued that cities and municipalities in Somalia have been remarkably effective at delivering "flexible, inclusive, hybrid governance." On balance, then, the gap between life in Somalia and life in other countries is not as large as might be expected, and in fact, a 2015 report from the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada documented that as the security situation has improved many Somalis have chosen to return to the country from abroad.  Feisal Omar / ReutersA Somali family sits inside a traditional house during an event to showcase traditional Somali culture in Hamarweyne district in the capital Mogadishu, December 3, 2015.GETTING THEREThis is not to say, however, that things in Somalia are rosy. The limits of local, bottom-up governance are stark: local systems built on specific community-level institutions cannot scale effectively, and long-term planning or coordination of multiple institutions is a challenge. For example, the Shuraako report documented that electricity provided by local Somali actors reaches about 60 percent of the area within major cities. That figure hits roughly 23 percent in smaller cities. But grid-delivered electrification in Somalia has failed to reach the countryside at all. In the absence of state taxation and development, small-scale, private electric provider networks have not been able to fund or execute that kind of large-scale infrastructure development.The same can be said for other utility networks. The 2014 Human Development Index ranked Somalia\'s average life expectancy--55.1 years--as the 177th worst out of the 191 countries and territories ranked, and other human development statistics proved impossible to quantify due to lack of data. Security also remains a challenge: although Somalia has experienced some success at developing security forces at the municipal level, the absence of a strong national military has allowed warlords, as well as violent criminal and political groups, to take control in some regions. Al-Shabaab provides an example of a group strong enough to pose an existential threat to the nation\'s federal government. When Somalia\'s ad-hoc networks tackle issues that require national-level resources and coordination, they--and the system--fail.WHAT WORKS, WHAT DOESN\'T  This complicated landscape of more and less effective systems of governance poses a challenge to the international organizations that operate within Somalia. International institutions that are charged with responding to the systemic challenges of security and service provision in Somalia, such as the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) or international development agencies, can work alongside existing sub-governmental institutions or they can choose to set up new structures that may compete with them. These decisions have implications for the long-term stability of Somalia. Somalian development programs focused on power generation, for example, may run the risk of undermining existing locally-driven companies through subsidized power or through new systems technically incompatible with existing systems if they don\'t engage directly with the current landscape of service providers. At the same time, purely local development can fail when braced with planning and coordination challenges at the national level, or when hard security issues that require national-level resources are at stake. This is also complicated by the fact that international development funding frequently requires organizations to work with and through the Somali federal government, which limits their ability to supporting non-governmental systems even when those systems work better than their federally supported replacements. One solution to this is to adopt a "fund what works" approach where possible, where organizations work with systems on their basis of local support, rather than what the formal institutional sector supplies. Some organizations may exist outside of the central governing structure, but are far more efficient; operating without their buy-in undermines systems that already work. This approach works best, however, when also engages with national-level institutions that coordinate and address national-level challenges. A dual approach that invests in local non-state or sub-state systems while also coordinating with institutions responsible at the national level can help development and stability initiatives in Somalia. Some institutions are already putting this into place, as in the case of the upcoming "Somali renewable energy Forum" hosted by Shuraako, focusing on a multi-track development approach encouraging direct investment with local businesses and governmental regulations to support renewable energy.  Feisal Omar / ReutersA money changer counts local currency notes at a local bureau where $100 US dollar exchanges for 750,000 Somaliland shillings in Hargeysa May 19, 2015.Understanding how supposedly ungoverned spaces are governed is important not just to Somalia but to the world. There are many other parts of the world that have no real state government in control. Afghanistan and Pakistan\'s tribal areas, the trans-Sahara region, and parts of northern Mali and Niger all represent ungoverned spaces in varying degrees. In all of these places, international institutions can make headway by working in tandem with existing structures, even if they are not tied with nominal federal governments. Organizations should not assume that an absence of government means an absence of public goods or systems designed to resolve collective needs and issues. To be sure, many of these institutions are insufficient, but others may function fairly well. Wherever this is the case, international development workers need to question whether what they are doing helps close gaps in local governance or punches holes in a system that could otherwise accomplish the tasks usually left for more conventional governments.

S"In the United States, the dominant narrative about Colombia holds that the country is a remarkable success story: a constitutional democracy surviving a prolonged and vicious insurgency while diversifying and growing its economy and significantly reducing poverty. The well-edited and accessible articles by leading U.S. and Colombian experts collected in this timely volume recognize those achievements but also maintain a sharp focus on the country's remaining challenges: government violations of human rights, systemic corruption and organized crime, weak institutions, rural poverty, stark economic inequality, and nearly five million internally displaced persons. Negotiations that aim to end the decades-long war between the government and the guerillas of the farc (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia)--talks heroically pursued by Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos--appear close to achieving resolution. But even if the parties reach a deal, Colombia will struggle to find the right balance between justice and peacemaking, between accountability and reconciliation. Readers of this volume will be ably guided through these topics and others, including Colombian foreign policy and the contributions and sins of U.S. policy and diplomacy in Colombia. blank"

S'This is the first in a series of essays on U.S.-Mexican cross-border relations titled The Anatomy of a Relationship, which the Woodrow Wilson Center\'s Mexico Institute is releasing over a period of months. It contains stark, frank revelations regarding the post-9/11 ambitions of the U.S. national security bureaucracy. The two authors, senior officials at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security writing in their personal capacities, describe their agency\'s redefinition of its mission vis--vis Mexico, moving away from simply securing a "line in the sand" and toward a deep penetration into Mexican territory. Under this expansive security paradigm, the DHS\' power, budget, and personnel have vastly increased. At the same time, the DHS has embraced more efficient "risk-based" methodologies that save time and money and promise a better balance between security and economic goals. Looking to the future, the authors foresee a "North American Century," not with European-style shared sovereignty but rather with "trinational conceptions and tripartite associations." The authors also wish to expand the security perimeter beyond Mexico, writing that "the long-term benefits of integrating Central America (and the island countries of the Caribbean) economically into North America are self-evident." blank'

S'Russia distinguishes itself by the scale of corruption plaguing its economic and political systems. Street gangs are the entry point, and as in other countries, their roles extend beyond mere criminal activity. Stephenson plunges deeply into the world of Russian gangs, focusing on Tatarstan, a region where they have flourished. She examines neighborhood gangs of teenage street toughs; "entrepreneurial" Mafia-like groups that control business empires; and, in between those two types, vigilantes who commandeer territory, shaking down local businesses and managing illicit activities. She attributes the surge of such groups in the 1990s to the voids and stresses created by the collapse of the Soviet Union. But she also reveals the evolution that Russian gangs have undergone during the last 20 years. Many street gangs have gone from offering something akin to protective refuge to focusing on more predatory activities, and the more serious criminal groups have shifted from prosaic racketeering and extortion to big business. Stephenson\'s analysis is informed by the fieldwork of others and by her own interviews with current and former gang members, law enforcement officials, teachers, school psychologists, and local residents. blank'

S'At what point does an extremist become a violent extremist? As the world--wakened by the recent terrorist attacks in Baghdad, Beirut, Paris, and now in California and London, too--struggles to defeat the Islamic State (also called ISIS), the answer is more important than ever.For his part, U.S. President Barack Obama has tried to solve the puzzle by introducing a new ingredient to the counterterrorism recipe. In February 2015, he gathered the world\'s top experts for a summit on countering violent extremism, a new strategy designed to address the process of radicalization--in particular, ISIS\' apparently unmatched ability to recruit across linguistic, cultural, and geographic boundaries through social media.Countering violent extremism is different in approach from the one that analysts and policymakers took with al Qaeda. Where they once hunted down operatives and leaders in the top echelons of terrorist organizations, they now also look for so-called influencers and study how, precisely, they incite individuals to violence. Consequently, U.S. counterterrorism has moved from a purely operations-centered strategy--for example, assassinating al Qaeda leaders or what the media calls "cutting off the snake\'s head"--to analyzing what the Department of Homeland Security describes as "the dynamics of radicalization to violence" or the reasons why some individuals associated with violent extremism commit violence and others do not. This new perspective has roped in government bodies, activists, and data scientists who not only analyze terrorist social networks and messaging patterns, but also transmit counter-extremist narratives.  U.S. Customs and Border Protection Handout / Reuters The San Bernardino attackers, Tashfeen Malik, (L), and Syed Farook are pictured passing through Chicago\'s O\'Hare International Airport in this July 27, 2014 handout photo obtained by Reuters, December 8, 2015.As a result, Washington certainly has an abundance of information about ISIS\' ideology, targets, messages, and media campaigns. But the challenge, it seems, is figuring out what to do with all the data. The Washington Post recently revealed that the U.S. State Department\'s Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications is rethinking its counter-messaging strategy after an outside panel gave it poor marks on effectiveness. Although the White House\'s summit on countering violent extremism in February admirably paved the way for the U.S. State Department and other agencies to begin collaborating with regional partners to tackle locally bred extremism--cultivating grassroots knowledge and empowering local, moderate voices--the local focus risks overlooking the possibility of more salient transregional ideologies that radicalize to violence. Similarly, although they deserve much credit for building partnerships with local communities, domestically oriented programs for countering violent extremism tend to focus disproportionately on mental health and economic factors. These may account for some degree of social estrangement, but they too overlook the exceptional nature of ISIS\'s ideological radicalization to violence. In short, our countering violent extremism policies do little, if anything, to address the very root cause and means of ISIS\' radicalization to violence--its ideology.To enhance the countering violent extremism project and stop ISIS recruitment, Washington should look to game theory.THE SCHELLING POINTS OF RADICALIZATIONIn 1960, at the height of the Cold War, Nobel Prize-winning American economist Thomas Schelling introduced the world to his "theory of strategy," an adaptation of game theory to the world of international relations. In his book, The Strategy of Conflict, Schelling coined the concept of a "focal point" (now known as a "Schelling point") to describe how individuals and nations reach an agreement when bargaining with each other. The process involves anticipating what the other person or country might do. To demonstrate, in the 1950s, Schelling asked a group of students to pick a place in New York City where they could meet a stranger without having coordinated a place and time beforehand. Without knowing what any of the other students said, most of them not only picked the information booths at Grand Central Station, but nearly all chose to arrive at noon.Schelling later conducted a second experiment. He gave a group of people sheets of paper with 16 squares. He promised a prize if they all checked the same box. Statistically speaking, only six percent should have checked the same one. In reality, 60 percent checked the top left square. This means that people can reach the same conclusion when properly motivated without having even spoken to one another.Although Schelling certainly could not have foreseen the application of this idea to defeating ISIS, it is eerily appropriate. If we apply the 16 squares scenario with radicalization, what we are trying to prevent is, in effect, this "psychic moment," as Schelling calls it, when likeminded individuals all come to check the same box: engage in terrorism. Around 20,000 plus foreign fighters, many of whom grew up in prosperous, democratic countries, have already done so.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display("dfp-ad-x90_2");    });          To enhance the countering violent extremism project and stop ISIS recruitment, Washington should look to game theory.        Jacky Naegelen / Reuters  French flags hang from windows of a building near the Invalides in Paris, France, November 27, 2015. The French President called on all French citizens to hang the tricolor national flag from their windows to pay tribute to the victims of the Paris attacks during a national day of homage.          In Schelling\'s theory, these individuals would have made their decision through "rational behavior...based on an explicit and internally consistent value system." For jihadists, that value system is Salafism. Given the fact that most of the world\'s Salafis are not violent, however, it cannot be the Salafi ideology alone that encourages violence. Moreover, given that ISIS disseminates a good deal of nonviolent messaging--it recently released its own set of textbooks on geography, history, and Arabic poetry for a course to "educate" future jihadists--it is not violence alone that attracts individuals to its worldview.It is, rather, ISIS\' ability to sell and validate its worldview in light of distinct circumstances that Muslim communities either experience or observe. Specifically, for both those socially and economically disenfranchised by life in the developed world, as well as for those experiencing or witnessing the violent unrest in Syria, ISIS offers the promise of a tranquil and authentic Islamic state, full of opportunity for those who accept its authority. The brutality and sectarian nature of the Shiite-Alawite regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad further buttresses ISIS\' cause because it validates its claims that only its Sunni worldview is just and fair. Indeed, the group\'s carefully curated magazine, Dabiq, consistently juxtaposes pictures and stories of ISIS providing for its people (i.e., medical care to children, repairing bridges and roads, etc.) with profiles of fighters who were killed, allegedly in defense of such projects.Essentially, those who buy into ISIS\' worldview opt for terrorism not as an ends but rather, as a means for joining a cause in which they can find both physical and spiritual fulfillment. Schelling himself noted in 1980 that "terrorism is contagiously suggestive and furthermore looks easier the more there is of it." In addition, as terrorism grows locally, Schelling asserts, "the easier it is to get away with it because counterterrorist forces are overextended and \'saturated.\'"DECONSTRUCTING THE RADICAL FRAMEBut ideology alone doesn\'t draw recruits to Syria. If the West is serious about preventing a "focal point of radicalization" from ever being created, it will not be enough to counter the ISIS narrative. That is because theoretically, focal points need a foundation--after all, to check the same box among 16, there first needs to be a grid, or what British economist Michael Bacharach calls a "frame." He has contributed greatly to game theory by explaining how frames lead to the creation of Schelling points. He defines a frameas "the set of concepts or predicates an agent uses in thinking about the world." In the case of ISIS recruitment, then, the task at hand is not simply to refute ISIS propaganda, but to prevent a potential recruit from setting up this frame.ISIS helps construct this frame in two ways. It offers material enticements (concubines, money) and ideological ones--the promise of a society based on a highly rigid strand of Sunnism whose principal appeal is its claim of truly representing the vision of the Prophet Muhammad. It has shown it can deliver on both. It has quickly overtaken large swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria and enacted its version of sharia. It has earned hundreds of millions of dollars through oil sales, ransoms, the selling of looted artifacts, and taxes, just to name a few the group\'s methods.However, when this frame fails, it also becomes the principal catalyst for driving potential recruits away from ISIS. Indeed, the New York Times recently revealed in an article titled, "Promise of Statehood Falling Far Short," that former "citizens" of the Islamic State were disgruntled by the group\'s excessive taxes, inability to pay its fighters, and the closure of hospitals and schools since they were "stresses [that] could provide opportunities for the group\'s many enemies." If we consider the promise of a functioning and fair Islamic state to be a frame for recruits to arrive at the focal point of terrorism, then the West could chip away at this frame by further crippling ISIS\' governance abilities. From the perspective of countering violent extremism, this objective can be achieved operationally rather than rhetorically, by stopping cash flow and disrupting access to natural resources. Essentially, these tactics increase the "stresses" on the functions of the state and prevent the realities on the ground from validating their narrative.

British detectives have charged a man with attempted murder after a knife attack at Leytonstone station.  But the Western world also helps in erecting frames. In 2013, Obama put a red line on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\'s use of chemical weapons. When it was discovered a few months later in August that Assad had, in fact, used chemical weapons, the United States decided not to do anything. Salafi-jihadists perceived the move as tacit approval of Assad\'s oppression of Syrian Sunnis. In the fourth issue of Dabiq, released in September 2014, the group featured a lengthy story on Washington\'s support for the Shiite-majority Iran titled, "The crusade serving Iran and Russia." The article also cited how the Assad regime has "managed to \'hide\' chemical weapons from the West and use them without a deterrent." Thus, the president\'s inaction indirectly served as a powerful call to arms that further escalated ISIS\' cause. In a July 2014 op-ed in the New York Times, scholars Chams Eddine Zaougui and Pieter Van Ostaeyen noted that after interviewing foreign fighters who had returned home, they realized that these recruits were motivated by Assad\'s "industrial-scale torture, barrel bombs, and chemical attacks." Zaougui and Ostaeyen explained that Assad\'s ruthlessness "evokes a strong desire to defend fellow Muslims" and criticize the West "for, as they see it, standing idly by over Syria." Zaougui and Van Ostaeyen also observe that of a small contingent of the nearly 350 Belgian fighters in Syria (as of July 2014) "most started as idealists." More recently, last Saturday\'s knife attacker on the London tube affirmed this view when he reportedly shouted, "This is for Syria."As Bacharach explains this "is a story of the progressive internalization of these externalities." This internalization, as Bacharach explains, could involve "a tendency to feel shame at failing to do the acts in question, especially when the failure is observed by others." When the Assad regime used chemical weapons against its own people, this may have led potential jihadists in internalizing this situation. When ISIS entered the scene, it provided a Sunni call to arms and enabled potential recruits to externalize their frustrations.A policy of striking at the heart of ISIS recruitment should involve not only countering the ideology, but rather, rewriting the narrative of events. The aim in doing so should be preventing two "psychic moments" from taking place among would-be jihadists: first, the framing of regional conflicts in sectarian terms and, second, the perception that ISIS is the solution to these conflicts. To accomplish both, the West must form a strategy that empowers local actors who want to rebuild stable, inter-sectarian states (and these voices do still exist) and, simultaneously, continue to destroy ISIS\' infrastructure and state capabilities. Doing both would show not only that ISIS\' narrative is inauthentic, but also that in practice, it is unrealistic. While no partnerships should be made unconditionally, and while no effective strategy on the ground will definitively eliminate the threat of terrorism, an inclusionary approach--one that engages local groups committed to defeating ISIS--may be the most vivid, if not realistic way to eliminate ISIS\' focal points of radicalization.

S'Fears about terrorism may have been heightened by the attacks in Paris and in San Bernardino. But they were already high even before these events and before the rise of the Islamic State (ISIS) in 2014. Public opinion poll data show that the United States suffers a long-term, routinized, mass anxiety--or at least a sense of concern--about terrorism that has shown little sign of waning in the years since 2001. Although other issues--particularly economic ones--often crowded out terrorism as a topic of daily concern, terrorism has won an apparently permanent space in the American mind.For example, over 70 percent of those polled in late 2001 believed that "another terrorist attack causing large numbers of Americans to be lost" was likely. The figure was roughly the same just before the rise of ISIS. Along the way, it was temporarily pushed up by some ten percentage points by the London attacks of 2005, and a similar rise occurred after the recent Paris attacks. Similarly, at the end of 2001, 35 to 40 percent professed to be worried about becoming a victim of terrorism, a level that has held ever since.  Mike Blake / ReutersA police SWAT team conducts a manhunt after a mass shooting in San Bernadino, California December 2, 2015.Poll data on beliefs about which side was winning the war against terrorism has bounced around quite a bit, particularly in response to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Overall, though, public opinion was almost exactly the same in 2011 as it was ten years earlier. The percentage maintaining that terrorists remain capable of launching "another major attack" was, if anything, higher in 2013 and 2014 than in 2002.Increased spending on domestic homeland secu-rity since 9/11 has totaled well over $1trillion, and efforts to chase down and eliminate terrorists abroad have cost trillions more. These extraordinary expenditures have utterly failed to make people feel safer. In 2013 and 2014, Americans were more likely to deem their country to be less safe than before 9/11 than they were a decade or so earlier. The rise of ISIS has pushed that figure even higher.These results suggest that the public has internalized the impact of 9/11, and there has been no erosion of fear even though concerns about another 9/11 have failed to pan out, Osama bin Laden has been dispatched, and an American\'s chance of being killed by a terrorist has been, and remains, one in four million per year with 9/11 included in the calculation, or one in 110 million for the period since 2001.    Saul Loeb / ReutersU.S. President Barack Obama speaks about the fight against ISIS during an address to the nation from the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, December 6, 2015.Terrorist attacks haven\'t always had such far-reaching psychological consequences. Fear about terrorism declined rapidly after the Oklahoma City bombing of 1995, for example. The difference with the post-9/11 era seems to be that those perpetrators--whether from al Qaeda or now ISIS--are seen as being connected to a spooky and persistent foreign adversary.In many respects, the best parallel is with fears that lingered for decades about the dangers presented by domestic communists, who were seen as being linked to a hostile international movement. As FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover put it in the 1950s, the American Communist Party was working "day and night" with "deadly seriousness" to seize power in the country in a process that was "virtually invisible to the non-communist eye." His dire warnings struck a responsive chord.Although politicians and other leaders could and should be doing much more to put the terrorism threat in its relevant context, it is not at all clear that doing so would allay public fear very much. Communism could convincingly die out. However, even if ISIS were to be destroyed as a meaningful force in the Middle East, its image could continue to inspire not only real terrorist attempts, but imaginary ones as well. '

S'In this pathbreaking study, Hall argues that emotionalism in diplomacy often serves a strategic purpose. Emotional outbursts can be useful for states seeking to reframe issues and project a new image to foreign audiences. In the 1995-96 crisis in the Taiwan Strait, China employed what Hall calls "the diplomacy of anger," seeking to signal through provocative missile tests that Washington had crossed a boundary by allowing Taiwan\'s president to visit the United States. Following the 9/11 attacks, China and Russia engaged in "the diplomacy of sympathy," signaling tacit acceptance of the United States\' security predicament and suggesting new possibilities for great-power accommodation. Germany\'s postwar "diplomacy of guilt" toward Israel has entailed not just statements of remorse but also costly reparations, through which Germany has rehabilitated its international image. Hall paints a fascinating picture of emotionalism as both diplomatic theater and rational calculation, but his book is inconclusive on its efficacy. Hall thinks that the "sincerity" of emotional gestures matters. Yet in politics, it\'s often difficult to know exactly what to consider sincere. blank'

S"No one can understand today's sad, tangled confrontation over Ukraine without some knowledge of the complex, crosscutting influences that have shaped eastern Europe over the millennia. For that history, readers can find no better place to turn than Plokhy's new book. Plokhy begins all the way back in the fifth century BC, exploring the origins of the Slavs, and then gives equal weight to each subsequent phase of Ukraine's story. He moves through each stage of the territory's history as it fell under the rule of a succession of groups and political entities: the Vikings, the Byzantine Empire, the Mongols, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Russian empire, the Soviet Union, and finally an independent Ukraine. Plokhy demonstrates a remarkable ability to untwist the dozens of trends, forces, and players marauding across this land and to take their measure in clear, compact segments. Ukraine's history has always been contested, and never more intensely than now. Plokhy navigates the subject with grace and aplomb. blank"

S"In circumstances he never quite explains, Sundaram spent some time in Rwanda in recent years conducting a workshop for local journalists. In this capacity, he befriended a number of young reporters struggling under increasing pressure from the government of President Paul Kagame. By the end of the book, they are all either in jail, in hiding, exiled--or working for Kagame's government. Sundaram's heartfelt chronicle closely observes the mechanisms by which the Kagame regime has curtailed freedom of the press by co-opting, intimidating, arresting, and even committing violence against independent journalists. Sundaram complains bitterly about the heroic reputation that Kagame has earned in the West for his efforts to rebuild the country after the 1994 genocide; in Sundaram's view, Kagame actually runs a police state intent on limiting even the most timid forms of opposition to its rule at the same time as it receives substantial foreign aid. Despite an appendix detailing the government's harsh treatment of several dozen Rwandan journalists over the last two decades, the book relies too heavily on a mood of brutality and doom rather than a careful analysis of the regime and its methods. Still, Sundaram has written an unsettling account of journalists under fire. blank"

S'Scrambling to understand Donald Trump\'s wild and, so far, remarkably effective campaign for the presidency, commentators have rushed to find parallels to explain the man who has dominated coverage and led in most polls of likely Republican voters. Some see the orange-maned billionaire as a fascist akin to Hitler or Mussolini or compare him with such bygone American demagogues as Father Charles Coughlin, Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy, or Alabama Governor George Wallace. Others maintain that he is a homegrown version of Russian President Vladimir Putin or French National Front leader Marine Le Pen.But, at best (or worst), Trump bears only a superficial resemblance to any of these individuals. He evinces no desire to create a militarized state that abolishes free elections and jails or executes its critics, as did the former dictators of Germany and Italy. If he expanded welfare programs and commanded industrial firms to produce what he wanted, as did Hitler and Mussolini, Trump would alienate those conservatives who now cheer his hostility to immigrants and the media. Neither does Trump share Coughlin\'s religious zealotry or McCarthy\'s fondness for accusing federal officials of treason. And there\'s a sharp contrast between Wallace\'s blue-collar belligerence at soft-handed elites and the real estate mogul\'s incessant boasting about how much money he has made and how famous he is. Further to compare Trump with the shrewd Russian autocrat or the seasoned French hypernationalist is like comparing a carnival barker with a brilliant, if malevolent, magician.The Trump phenomenon is better understood as an amalgam of three different, largely pathological strains in American history and culture. To search for a single individual whom he most resembles misses the larger forces that churn out figures who storm their way through the political universe, leaving damages for others to repair.  David Moir / ReutersU.S. property mogul Donald Trump gestures during a media event on the sand dunes of the Menie estate, the site for Trump\'s proposed golf resort, near Aberdeen, north east Scotland, May 27, 2010.The first and perhaps most obvious strain is hostility toward immigrants whose ethnic and religious identities seem to clash with those of the native-born majority. In the 1850s, the American Party--labeled the "Know-Nothings" by its opponents--accused Irish and German Catholics of being agents of the pope and a threat to republican government. Later in the century, white workers on the Pacific coast led a mass campaign against Chinese newcomers, whom they blamed for undercutting wages and spreading disease. Federal lawmakers affirmed their bigotry by excluding anyChinese laborers from entering the United States. In the 1920s, fears of Slavs, Jews, Italians, and others suspected of being hostile to America\'s white "Nordic" heritage persuaded Congress to impose quotas that all but banned immigrants from eastern and southern Europe. Trump\'s attacks on "rapists and murderers" crossing the southern border and on potential Muslim terrorists jetting across the Atlantic belong to this long and ignominious tradition.The GOP front-runner\'s contempt toward established political authorities also echoes American populists\' past. "We are fighting in the defense of our homes, our families, and posterity. We have petitioned, and our petitions have been scorned," Future Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan declared in 1896. "We have entreated, and our entreaties have been disregarded. We have begged, and they have mocked when our calamity came. We beg no longer; we entreat no more; we petition no more. We defy them!" Trump\'s gibes at "stupid" and "incompetent" politicians in both major parties are quite crude in comparison, but the sentiment is similar.At the same time, Trump\'s attacks are far less coherent than the indictments hurled by the original Populists during the Gilded Age or, for that matter, by Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders today. Bryan\'s followers lambasted officeholders who sent troops to break strikes but would not spend a dollar to help the unemployed. Sanders rails against Wall Street investors who "used their wealth and power to get Congress to do their bidding for deregulation and then, when their greed caused their collapse, they used their wealth and power to get Congress to bail them out." Yet Trump mostly derides the governing class for its supposed psychological flaws: he claims that most politicians are too "weak," "dishonest," or confused to address what ails the nation.What\'s more, his vow to "Make America Great Again" lacks any explanation of what or who made it so wonderful before. Searching his website for clues turns up no proposals that might credibly bring about a national revival--unless one believes that a simplified tax code and a stern crackdown on illegal immigration amount to a sufficient blueprint for major change.  Adrees Latif / ReutersA seagull flies past the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino, one of two casinos owned by Trump Entertainment Resorts, in Atlantic City, New Jersey, September 15, 2014.Of course, Trump thunders that he will destroy the nation\'s enemies overseas, although here, too, he mostly leaves the details to the imagination. As far back as 1987, Trump was making the same aggressive pitch. He ran full-page ads in major newspapers asserting, "There\'s nothing wrong with America\'s Foreign Defense policy that a little backbone can\'t cure. . . . Let\'s not let our country be laughed at anymore." Since this was a veiled attack on U.S. President Ronald Reagan, Republicans either ignored Trump or denounced him.Yet today, at a time when nearly all Republicans and a good many Democrats think politicians either cannot or will not stop America\'s decline, Trump\'s refusal to elaborate on his campaign slogan has appeal. A candidate who makes no specific promises can never disappoint his followers. Trump\'s populism of derision--directed against the media as well as the political elite--thus fixes nearly all attention on the image and personality of the man himself.In this way, he belongs to a familiar tradition of celebrity businessmen who used their riches and renown to gain an outsize influence in debates about the nation\'s future. Industrialists such as Leland Stanford and Andrew Carnegie and financiers such as Jay Cooke and J. P. Morgan once held a whip hand over the American economy. The press covered each man\'s every act of civic consequence--whether breaking a strike, causing or soothing a stock market panic, or donating millions of dollars to a good cause. Rarely, however, did such men run for political office. Why take a chance on losing when their economic clout already gave them sway over those who won?    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display("dfp-ad-x90_2");    });  One partial exception to the rule was Henry Ford. Like Trump, the Michigan automaker had a penchant for making controversial political statements that kept him in the news. As a pacifist, during World War I, Ford declared, "To my mind, the word \'murderer\' should be embroidered in red letters across the breast of every soldier." Then, in the early 1920s, his newspaper, TheDearborn Independent, published the vicious anti-Semitic forgery The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.  Henry Ford next to a 1921 Model-T.Ford, like Trump, moved back and forth between the major parties. In 1918, he was the Democratic candidate for a Senate seat in Michigan, a race he probably would have won if he had bothered to spend any money on it or campaign for himself. In 1924, despite or perhaps because of his notoriety, many Republicans wanted to draft him for president; a magazine poll in 1923 had him leading all other potential candidates. In the end, however, Ford decided not to run. He was as arrogant as Trump but lacked his political ambition.Yet the media never tired of the man who created the assembly line and the world\'s first affordable car. One journalist in the 1920s wrote that modern Americans were eager for "new sensations" that a "tame president" could not fulfill. "If you were a motion-picture producer," he wrote, "bent on furnishing a glimpse into the future . . . wouldn\'t you choose Henry Ford as your hero?"Both the allure of Trump\'s candidacy and the dread it provokes at home and abroad stem from the same impulses, which run deep in U.S. political culture. A rich man whose name is familiar to everyone bashes people whom many citizens either fear or mistrust and makes vague promises to fix whatever ails the nation. And he does all this with a smirk, a threat, and yet also with a yearning for respect, even from those he routinely assaults in speeches. Trump probably will not be elected president, and it would be a disaster if he was. But his act is hardly as novel as he, and many of his fans and his critics, believe. After he leaves the stage, another wealthy performer with a talent for bombast and no political record to defend may well take his place. '

S'A new editorial team led by Alejandro de la Fuente draws on scholarship from Cuba and around the world to make this multidisciplinary journal a must-read for those looking beyond the headlines for a deeper understanding of the rapid changes taking place on the island. This issue of the journal focuses on demographic trends. In one article, Sergio Diaz-Briquets warns of an alarming population decline, the consequence of low fertility rates and out-migration. He accuses Havana of "mortgaging the future for immediate short-term economic gain" by encouraging young Cubans to emigrate and send remittances back home. Alejandro Portes and Aaron Puhrmann document sharp divides within the Cuban American enclaves of South Florida, between the wealthier and better-networked arrivals of the 1960s and 1970s and the less well-educated, more isolated--and much less successful--Cuban immigrants who came later. These more recent immigrants have produced a resurgent transnationalism, as many continue to engage with their families in Cuba. Still unclear, however, is whether those ties across the Straits of Florida will generate greater political openness in Cuba or whether the Cuban regime\'s labor-exporting policies will promote a Vietnamese model of a hybrid economy under a single-party state. blank'
