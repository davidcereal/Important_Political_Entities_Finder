S'For the first time in six years, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization announced that it would expand its membership, inviting Montenegro to join the alliance. Only 16 years ago, NATO was bombing the small western Balkan nation as part of its intervention in Kosovo.With a standing military of only 2,000, Montenegro\'s membership will have little impact on the alliance\'s military strength. But the move has profound political consequences. It illustrates the progress that the western Balkans, and Montenegro in particular, have made since the bloody and traumatizing wars of the 1990s. To receive the invitation, Montenegro had to undertake a series of political, legal, and military reforms under the auspices of NATO\'s Membership Action Plan, a program that offers assistance and support for countries seeking to join the alliance. That a newly independent country could reach these standards in such a short time frame speaks to the enduring and powerful draw of the Euro-Atlantic community. In that sense, this remarkable success story comes at an opportune time--it is a bright spot in Europe\'s otherwise dark political terrain of internal strain, the refugee crisis, and the war in Ukraine.  Hazir Reka / ReutersProtesters flee from tear gas in the center of Kosovo\'s capital Pristina, November 18, 2015. Police and protesters clashed in Kosovo for a second day on Wednesday in a deepening crisis over relations with former ruler Serbia.Montenegro\'s membership also represents a major step toward consolidating political stability and democracy in the western Balkans; the reforms it undertook to reach this point include strengthening its governing structures and democratic institutions, as well as bringing its military up to NATO standards. NATO membership would also turn Montenegro into a regional leader and an example of how a small country, not even a decade old, can make great strides so long as it has enough political ambition. The move could inspire others, such as Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, to reenergize necessary reforms for eventual membership, a process that has stagnated in both countries. Montenegro\'s invitation would also send a signal to Georgia and Ukraine that NATO is, in fact, honoring its "open door policy," which was questioned in the face of Russia\'s annexation of Crimea.Russia is staunchly opposed to NATO expansion due to its deep-seated and historical fear of being "encircled" by a potential adversary. Within Russia, President Vladimir Putin inflates the threat of NATO as the country\'s top geopolitical foe in order to stoke Cold War-era tensions and consolidate domestic power. This makes curbing NATO expansion a strategic priority for Russia. Unsurprisingly, Russia quickly denounced NATO\'s invitation to Montenegro, which gained independence from Russia\'s natural ally in the region, Serbia, only nine years ago. Russia\'s Foreign Ministry called the decision "an openly confrontational step fraught with additional destabilizing consequences for the system of Euro-Atlantic security" and Dmitry Peskov, President Vladimir Putin\'s spokesman, said that NATO\'s expansion "cannot but result in retaliatory actions ... from the Russian side."Such warnings are likely rhetorical. Montenegro is more geographically insulated from Russia than Georgia or Ukraine. It\'s more likely that Russia will retaliate through political or economic channels instead. Already, pro-Russian groups in Montenegro have taken to the streets to protest against NATO membership and have also called for the resignation of Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic. Russia may stoke further civil unrest in order to make the country appear too unstable to join NATO. That may not be difficult to do. Domestically, Montenegro faces anti-NATO factions including from within both the Orthodox Church and political parties that emphasize ties to Serbia and Russia over NATO.Russia also has substantial economic leverage over the country, particularly in the tourism and real estate industries (an estimated 40 percent of Montenegrin real estate is Russian-owned); thus, Moscow, which placed a food embargo on Montenegro after it sided with the West on Ukraine, could slap on more sanctions in order to further punish the country for its Western-leaning political ambitions.  Marko Djurica / ReutersKosovo Serb boys stand on the street during a protest, October 17, 2011.Domestically, Montenegro\'s public is skeptical that NATO membership will be economically beneficial and is wary of the current government\'s motives, since Djukanovic, the very man who has steered his country toward NATO inclusion, has been charged with financial corruption. An investigation by the BBC in 2012 found that he and his associates were using a partially public-funded bank for their own personal use.When the 28 NATO members vote on Montenegro\'s membership in the coming year, Russia can fund anti-NATO political parties in countries more susceptible to Russian money, such as Hungary, Greece, or the Czech Republic, to vote, "no." In the past, NATO members\' parliaments have always deferred to their government\'s decision on NATO enlargement, but since the decision requires unanimous consensus among all 28 members, Russian influence remains a risk. The most likely scenario, however, is that Russia will look to prevent Serbia from following Montenegro\'s path. In recent years, Russia has worked to consolidate influence in Serbia and Republika Srpska, the ethnically Serb entity in Bosnia and Herzegovina, through economic aid and military cooperation.The EU opened accession talks with Serbia in the wake of the announcement about Montenegro\'s NATO membership. This demonstrated a rare example of coordination between NATO and the EU, two institutions that struggle to work together because of political divisions between two of its members, Turkey and Cyprus. But this move also opens new avenues for Russia to derail progress in the Balkans, either through Serbia\'s EU accession talks or through the fragile Serbia-Kosovo peace deal that the EU brokered in 2013.Crises in the Middle East and Ukraine have pushed the Balkans down on the priority list for many transatlantic leaders. But it is time to pay attention to the region again. Its relative calm and peace should not be taken for granted. Economic distress and the refugee and migrant crisis have stretched the Balkans\' fledgling democracies to their limits and opened new avenues for Russian interference. Bosnia risks backsliding into political turmoil, and Macedonia\'s ambitious political and democratic reforms suffered a monumental setback this summer after a scandal over the government\'s wiretaps of opposition leaders and ethnic violence in the Kumanovo region. Even the watershed Serbia-Kosovo peace deal hangs by a thread today; Kosovo erupted in protests last month after the government made a deal with Serbia to integrate Serb-majority regions in Kosovo--a move supported by Brussels. These are manifestations of deep-seated and unresolved political, ethnic, and economic stresses that are bubbling beneath the surface of ostensible progress toward European integration. That is why Montenegro\'s NATO membership invitation, although a major milestone, does not mean that peace in the region is a foregone conclusion. '

S'In Turkey, where there has been a rise in Islamic religiosity, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, founder of the pro-Islamist Development and Justice Party (AKP), is converting some public schools into seminaries called imam-hatips (or traditional training schools for Sunni Muslim clergy) in an effort to raise a generation of "religious youth."Students who perform poorly on entrance exams for secondary school are shunted into imam-hatips where they study the Koran for up to 13 hours a week and take courses on the life of the Prophet Muhammad and Arabic. Erdogan has boasted that during his tenure as president, enrollment in these schools soared from 63,000 to over one million. The number of imam-hatips increased by 73 percent between 2010 and 2014 and 13percent of Turkish students now study at such schools.Outraged, dozens of Turkish parents in Istanbul created an advocacy group called HandsOff My School to fight against Erdogan\'s education policy. In June of 2014, when the government tried to convert the local middle school to an imam-hatip, the group circulated a petition that quickly collected 13,000 signatures from other parents. A young lawyer from the neighborhood, Yasemin Zeytinoglu, even filed an emergency suspension with the Istanbul Administrative Court to halt the conversion.  Government officials eventually dropped the order to convert the school, giving the parents a short-lived victory. But the school stopped taking new students and after the current classes graduate, it will reopen as an extracurricular center. Left with no choice but to enroll their children in a different middle school, some parents told us that they felt the government was punishing them for protesting.In September, at the start of the 2014 school year, the members of Hands Off learned that 40,000 children were registered at imam-hatips without parental permission, including the grandson of Turkey\'s Chief Rabbi, Ishak Haleva. Hands Off, along with the tens of thousands of people from the secular teachers\' union and from religious minority groups, rallied forcefully in response. During one nationwide demonstration in February, the government responded by locking students inside their schools and calling the police to fire water cannons on protestors.In Gongoren, a working class borough of Istanbul where three middle schools were recently converted to imam-hatips, 50 men and women met over the summer with Zeytinoglu. She told her audience, "The decision to change the school wasn\'t legal. You were never asked if you wanted it to change." Zeytinoglu has five cases in front of the court now, each for a different school. She argued that in Gongoren, officials did not adequately consult parents and gave no notice before converting the school. Further, there was insufficient demand for religious education in the neighborhood given that it already had seven other imam-hatips.One parent, Gulay Kacar, a stout woman who wore a paisley headscarf, has a son in the fifth grade at Mehmet Akif Middle School, now an imam-hatip. To avoid religious education, which she said will deprive her son of science classes, she will have to send him to a school in another neighborhood where, "there is so much violence, people are stabbing each other." She told the parents, "They put pressure on us. They force our kids to have the education that they want."Kacar, along with Nurcan Aybalik, whose child was also a student at the now-converted school, set up a signature drive in the Kale Outlet Mall in the city center. Shortly after, five clean-shaven youths approached them and swore at the two women, telling them that they had loosened their headscarves and had made prostitutes of themselves by questioning Islam. "Islam is coming and we will make you observe our laws," they said, according to both Kacar and Aybalik.  Umit Bektas / ReutersStudents of an Imam Hatip high school march during a Republic Day ceremony in Ankara, Turkey, October 29, 2015.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display("dfp-ad-x90_2");    });  Extremist views are on the rise in Turkey. Twenty percent of Turks support responding to an insult against Islam with violence, up almost 8 percent from last year, according to the Turkish polling firm Metropoll. A Pew Research Center poll released last month reported that eight percent of Turkish people have a favorable opinion of ISIS and 19 percent are "undecided.""Because of the mindset of religious education, we are being polarized," said Aybalik. Erdogan and the AKP have fought hard to hold onto their tenuous majority in parliament, and religious values are a cornerstone of their message to their Sunni Muslim base. Meanwhile, political opponents warn that religious educational policies will polarize the citizenry. Minority groups, especially Alevi-Muslims, who follow a blend of Shia and syncretic beliefs and make up as much as 25 percent of the Turkish population, are increasingly alienated.In 2011, three Alevi Turkish parents of secondary school students brought a complaint before the European Court of Human Rights, stating that their children were forced to attend Sunni Islamic classes, in violation of the first protocol of the Convention on Human Rights Protocol: the right to education. In February of this year, the court made a final ruling, determining that Turkey\'s compulsory religious education violates children\'s rights. Turkey\'s own highest court ruled similarly in June, deeming the AKP\'s policies unconstitutional. The government has ignored these rulings. Some fear that the European Union, which recently pledged $3.2 billion in Syrian refugee aid to Turkey--in return for helping staunch the flow of migrants into Europe--may in the future turn a blind eye to such human rights abuses in Turkey.  Murad Sezer / ReutersTurkish girls read books at the library at the Kazim Karabekir Girls\' Imam-Hatip School in Istanbul, February 10, 2010.As for claims that these religious schools breed extremism, Turkey\'s religious leaders have countered that their Sunni education has nothing to do with radical Islam. "Islam is a religion of peace and we teach this," said Huseyin Korkut, the head of Onder, an umbrella organization for imam-hatip alumni. "Among the graduates [of imam-hatips] almost no one joined Al Qaeda or ISIS." Indeed, many graduates become public servants.  However, radicalism is a growing problem in Turkey. More than 1,000 have joined ISIS--many of them disaffected youth from neighborhoods with limited educational opportunities--and the presence of extremist recruitment cells in Turkey\'s southern provinces is well established. Although there is no evidence that the imam-hatips are a source of radicalization in Turkey, it is crowding out opportunities to build critical thinking and appreciation for other religions. That certainly does not help combat ISIS, an extremist group that justifies killing and raping of non-Muslim "apostates."To be sure, the problem isn\'t just a Turkish one. In ISIS-controlled areas of Iraq, the curriculum teaches the group\'s extreme Salafist interpretation of Islam, with a focus on militancy and fighting "non-believers," even at the primary school level. In Syria, even outside of ISIS\' domain, radical Islamic groups such as Jabhat al Nusra have opened sharia schools where girls must where the niqab and are segregated from boys. And in Jordan, which has sent 2,000 fighters to ISIS, schoolbooks teach that "holy war" and the killing of captured enemies are appropriate responses to attacks on Islamic lands. Zogan Obiedat, a former Education Ministry official, recently warned, "Islamic State ideology is there, in our textbooks." In fact, the Jordanian government has launched an initiative to rewrite its textbooks.For her part, Kacar insists that her fight is not against religious education for those that want it--she herself is a devout Sunni Muslim, although she did not go to an imam-hatip. She is fighting for the right to choose her child\'s education, a principle enshrined in international law. But for now, it seems that Erdogan is winning. At the end of November, the courts had not given a ruling on any of Zeytinoglu\'s five cases. Kacar was unable to keep her son at home any longer, and so he, along with hundreds of other children from Gongoren, started school in the next town over. '

S'"France is our oldest ally," U.S. President Barack Obama reminded Americans on November 13, after ISIS terrorists launched coordinated attacks in Paris, killing 130. Indeed, the French sent an ambassador to the breakaway colony back in 1778, and Benjamin Franklin arrived in Paris the next year, establishing the United States\' first foreign mission. Gerard Araud, a career diplomat who began as a Middle East specialist, has served as French ambassador to the United States since September 2014; before that, he led France\'s permanent mission to the UN. Araud spoke with Foreign Affairs deputy managing editor Stuart Reid at the French embassy in Washington, D.C., on December 16, 2015.The attacks on Paris were disturbing not just because of the loss of life but also because they struck a city that symbolizes openness. Have the attackers succeeded in jeopardizing the liberal values that Paris represents?The answer is no. But after such a terrorist attack, you are obliged to take some law-enforcement measures. Any liberal democracy has a delicate balance between civil liberties and law enforcement. After 9/11, you had the Patriot Act. After this attack, we have the state of emergency in France.More serious is that the attackers want to create a rift between French Muslims and other French citizens. The French authorities are very keen on avoiding it, but you saw the result of the recent elections in France, where the far right did very well.It\'s a bit like Trump. Trumpism is a transatlantic phenomenon. The problem of backlash against Muslim citizens that you have in this country after San Bernardino, we have in Europe.Why have Muslim immigrants to France, and even their children and grandchildren, had trouble integrating?May I ask you why African Americans have problems of integrating 10 generations after they arrived in the U.S.?The fact is that in Europe, not only in France, most of the recent immigrants are Muslims. Thanks to the economic crisis exported by the U.S. in 2008, Europe is going through an economic dire strait, especially in southern Europe, where the unemployment rate is very high. As usual, the people who are hit most by unemployment are the last to arrive: the immigrants. So we have problems of integration. But you don\'t blow yourself up because you are unemployed.When you look at the profile of Muslim terrorists, you discover that a lot of them were middle-class and had a job. Their parents were perfectly integrated. Very often, the profile of the radicalized youth is someone from a totally normal family that is Muslim, but in a very moderate way. And suddenly, they see their son or daughter getting radical--he starts not to touch his mother, starts to insult his sister because she wears Western clothing, and so on. Social integration is a challenge we all face. But the real question is the process of radicalization of a tiny part of the community.Why do U.S. conservatives love to bash France?    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display("dfp-ad-x90_2");    });  Actually, right now, it\'s the opposite. Conservatives in the U.S. love France because we were firm in negotiations with Iran, our soldiers are fighting in Mali against the terrorists, we were the first to join the American strikes against ISIS, and we have deployed an aircraft carrier in the Gulf to support the Americans.There has always been a tradition of French bashing, which is linked, I guess, to the fact that we are very two different countries. The U.S. was created against the British colonial state, so there is a tradition of considering the state the problem. Look at the guns issue. People say, "We need guns in case the state becomes a threat." In France, we have a totally different relationship with the state. When Tocqueville came to America and wrote Democracy in America in 1835, he emphasized this point.On top of this misunderstanding, we have the Iraq crisis of 2003, where we were right, obviously. The American intervention was a total geopolitical disaster.We\'ve gone from freedom fries to nous sommes tous franais.Exactement. What has been striking is the outpouring of American solidarity after the attack, from President Obama to the man in the street. Our embassy was totally overwhelmed by flowers, we have received thousands of messages, and people are still offering their condolences. Immediately after the November 13 attack, the U.S. administration was extremely supportive, especially in terms of intelligence sharing.We are shoulder to shoulder, facing the same challenge. The only difference is that thanks to your geography, you are much further from the danger than we are. But you have seen the same threat with San Bernardino.You mentioned the intervention in Mali. France has also intervened in the Central African Republic, and in 2013, President Hollande supported punishing Syria with airstrikes for using chemical weapons. What explains this more activist French foreign policy?Rather than seeing a general trend, look at each of these crises. In the case of Mali, the country was collapsing and could have been a failed state taken over by terrorists. It\'s a former French colony, and the second-biggest Malian city is a suburb of Paris. We have hundreds of thousands of Malians in France, and these people are shuttling back and forth, so it would have been extremely dangerous for us. And West Africa was a French colony, where we still have thousands of French citizens and dozens of French schools. We had to intervene to defend our interests.In Central Africa, it\'s totally different. It\'s a very poor country. It has absolutely no interest in economic terms, so we didn\'t have any appetite to intervene. But there were massacres between Muslims and Christians, and the public in France, contrary to the rest of the world, knows where the Central African Republic is, so there was pressure to end the slaughter. To be frank, the French army didn\'t want to go. This sort of mission is always extremely frustrating. Nevertheless, it was so awful that we decided to send a few hundred soldiers.Speaking of Syria in 2013, do you think Obama\'s decision not to go through with air strikes damaged U.S. credibility?I\'m a French ambassador to the U.S., so I\'m not going to criticize the president. But like my president has said publicly, you can always argue, but we think we could have changed the course of the war and should have proceeded with strikes against Assad.I can understand from the American perspective that core U.S. interests are not engaged in Syria. The problem is that for the Europeans--your most solid and ancient allies--the Syrian crisis is becoming critical. In terms of fighters, thousands of Europeans have gone to Syria, and they will come back. The second element is the more than one million migrants. Try to imagine what would happen in the U.S. if one million migrants were crossing the Rio Grande.What specifically could have been done earlier to prevent what\'s happening now?The key problem from the beginning is Assad. In 2011, you had peaceful demonstrations in Syria, and at the same moment, you had peaceful demonstrations across the border in Jordan. But the Jordanians tried to respond to the political and social demands of the demonstrators, while the Syrian regime simply shot at the demonstrators. After that, little by little, it became a civil war. The problem with civil wars, as we\'ve seen in Spain in \'36-\'39, is that usually, the moderates are not good soldiers, and the radicals are. The radical elements of the Syrian rebels have taken the upper hand. It\'s hypothetical, but in 2013, it could still have been possible to get rid of Assad and have a palatable Syrian alternative. Now, it\'s more difficult.Why has Vladimir Putin decided to intervene in Syria?The Russians have always been very clear. They said, "We are not married to Assad, but the choice is between Assad and the radical Jihadists, and we prefer Assad." Why have they substantially increased their presence? In the spring and summer of 2015, we saw many signals that the Syrian army was exhausted. Obviously, the Russians and the Iranians thought they had to step in to preserve the Syrian regime. That\'s the reason they are striking the opposition and not ISIS, because the people fighting Assad are the opposition and not ISIS.Is it possible the Russians are right that there is no good alternative to Assad at this point?What the Russians are telling us is, "OK, you don\'t like Assad, but that\'s not the priority. The priority is fighting ISIS, so let\'s fight ISIS together." And to fight and win, you need ground forces. If you look around the region, the Kurds are not going to fight ISIS, because they are defending Kurdistan. The Shiite militias from Baghdad are not going to fight ISIS, because they are defending their turf. They\'re not going to go to Mosul; they don\'t care about it. So you can say that the Assad army is the only solution. That\'s more or less what the Russians are telling us.Our answer is twofold. First, the Syrian army is exhausted. They can\'t do it. We estimate that around 40,000 Alawites have died, because the best forces are Alawites, and there are only 1.2 million of them. More important, ISIS is an answer to a real problem. We see ISIS only for its atrocities. Actually, ISIS is also filling a vacuum, which is Sunni-stan. With Assad on one side and the Shiites in Baghdad on the other, the Sunnis don\'t have a defender, so ISIS has stepped in. And if we support Assad, it will encourage more Sunnis to rally to ISIS. So our answer is, yes, it will be up to the Syrian army to do the job--but an inclusive Syrian army, after political transition in Damascus.How can you be sure that France\'s stepped-up air campaign doesn\'t create more terrorists than it destroys?Frankly, at some point, when you have enemies, you have to kill them. It\'s brutal, but it\'s a war. What would be the other solution? These people come to our countries and blow themselves up in our theaters. They are threatening us every day--threatening the security of French schools, the security of French embassies abroad. They don\'t leave us any other choice. We have to defeat them.What does a political settlement to the Syrian civil war look like?Our counter example is what the Americans did in Iraq. It\'s very important to keep the security apparatus of the regime intact so that the country doesn\'t collapse into total anarchy. We have to keep the Syrian army, we have to keep the Syrian security apparatus, we have to keep the administration at a high level.We have to have a government of national unity organizing elections to have a representative Syrian government. You can object, "Is it possible to organize free elections with Assad? Is it possible to organize elections considering that the opposition is really fragmented?" It\'s quite a challenge.It won\'t work if it\'s imposed from outside. It will work only if the Syrians are exhausted enough. A civil war stops either with the total victory of one side or when the people say, "enough is enough."What is the moral responsibility of France when it comes to accepting refugees from Iraq and Syria?There was an agreement between the EU countries to share the burden. France was supposed to take 24,000 refugees, and eventually, even after the attack, we are going to accept 30,000. We are facing the same situation that you are facing in terms of immigration. On one side, yes, there is a moral responsibility. We have to help these refugees. On the other side, we face the very strong reaction of the anti-immigrant movement.Also, and you can consider it a petty calculation, but the fact is, the more you accept immigrants, the more they come. We are in a dead end. We close our borders, these people are going to die on our shores, which is awful. We open our borders, and then there will be more people coming. And I don\'t know any country that is ready to accept millions of refugees.What do you make of the Front National?It\'s the same thing as Trump. Of course, Trump has his personal genius, but it\'s basically the same crisis. The lower middle class feels frightened by globalization, frightened for the future of its children, frightened for its moral and social values. They have the impression that the elite are cut off from them. So they want to try something new. So it\'s the Front National in France, or the extreme right in the Netherlands, or Mr. Trump. It\'s the same solution: building walls, closing borders. And it\'s the same scapegoat: the immigrant. It\'s sad.Do you think the United Kingdom will opt to leave the EU?It\'s possible, and it would be a disaster--for the U.K. and for the EU. We need the U.K. in the EU for a lot of different reasons. The problem is, to be frank, this is a British debate. No other country sees an interest in opening this debate.Does Germany have too much power within the EU?Countries have leverage proportional to their power. Because of its economic performance since the beginning of the crisis, Germany has a lot of influence. But if you ask the question to the Dutch, they will say that France and Germany and the U.K. have too much influence.You\'re perhaps the feistiest diplomat on Twitter. Has this ever gotten you in trouble with your masters back in Paris?When you arrive in Washington, you wonder, what is the use of an ambassador in the modern world? The relationship between the two countries is so intense--in terms of human exchanges, economic exchanges, financial exchanges--that frankly, it can work without the ambassador. As for the political relationship, the national security advisor in Paris is calling Susan Rice, and they don\'t need the ambassador. So I\'ve said, "Let\'s try to use social media"--not in terms of everybody in the country, but at least among journalists and deciders.Also, if you want to have real effectiveness, you have to be feisty. If you simply say, "France is in favor of peace and stability," you\'re not going to be exciting. You need to tease the audience to get their attention.It\'s an experiment. I\'m by far the French ambassador with the most followers, so Paris is following my experience. Maybe from time to time, they believe I went too far. But they have told me only once that I should delete a tweet. And I\'m not going to tell you which.Speaking of one tweet you did delete, after Donald Trump tried to make a political point about gun control after the Paris attacks, you called him a "vulture." Are most ambassadors too prudish about commenting on the domestic politics of the country that they\'re in?I didn\'t comment on domestic politics, because it was after he had said if the French had been allowed to have guns, it wouldn\'t have happened. I was just driving back home, and it was in the moment of a tragedy. That\'s the reason I reacted by saying he\'s a vulture: the blood is still not dry, and already he\'s making this sort of comment. Two hours later, I deleted it--I was not asked to by Paris--because I said, "I\'m not going to enter into a controversy while my people are being killed."I went on Fox News a few days later, and they said, "Don\'t you think that if guns had been available in France, the French could have defended themselves against terrorists?" I simply said, "No, it doesn\'t work this way; it\'s only in the movies." I came back home. On my Twitter account, I had hundred of insults--hundreds!--coming from people from Nevada, Arizona, with 45 followers.Have you been watching the Republican debates?  Yes.What\'s your reaction?We are foreigners. I\'ve always said to my diplomats, "You should consider that we are different." A lot of people believe that Europeans and Americans are more or less alike, with small differences. And I think that approach is leading to misunderstanding. Actually, we are different--in our history, in our political traditions, in our visions of the world. '

S'Hunting giraffes with an AK-47 is not an activity that most people associate with the life of a terrorist, but for al Shabab, big game hunting is but one of the many perks of membership. A recent al Shabab video depicted fighters stalking and shooting giraffes, antelope, and buffalo, frolicking in a swimming hole, and sharing large plates of fresh fruit within Somalia\'s lush expanses. Compared to the brutality of recruitment videos from the Islamic State (also known as ISIS), al Shabab is peddling a softer version of jihad.This take on jihadi life is not always standard fare for the Somali terror group. Al Shabab\'s cinematic efforts often feature brutality and violence. This video, however, is part of an attempt to reinvigorate a key element of its rise that saw it become, for a time, one of the world\'s most prominent terrorist organizations. By casting jihad as a life of adventure and excitement, al Shabab is again trying to lure Western recruits. And its chances of success grow daily.Al Shabab has always prized foreign recruits. In 2008, its spokesman Mukhtar Robow extolled foreign fighters as a "precious element" the group needed to attract. Particularly valued were battle-hardened terrorists from other conflict areas, including Afghanistan and Iraq, who brought fighting acumen, technological skills, and leadership experience. At one time, more than half of al Shabab\'s governing council was thought to be non-Somali.Unskilled recruits from the West have been useful as well. Anywhere from 20 to 60 Somali-Americans joined al Shabab as novice fighters. At least three of them became suicide bombers; others became foot soldiers or propagandists. Several non-Somali Americans also joined the group, as did citizens of Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.  AMISOMA still from Al Shabab\'s recruitment video, geared toward Western recruits.Al Shabab\'s Western recruitment efforts dried up as word of the group\'s brutality toward Somalis and non-Somalis (even those within the group) began to spread. Several attacks within Somalia also soured the public on al Shabab, notably the 2008 suicide attack on a Mogadishu medical school graduation. Its decision to bar aid from southern Somalia during the 2011-2012 famine did not help either; it led to a quarter of a million starvation deaths and destroyed what little support the group had within the Somalian diaspora.Since 2009, there have been few reports of Somali-Americans joining the group; radicalized Somali-Americans instead have preferred to join Middle Eastern terrorist groups such as ISIS. Still, al Shabab tries to woo Westerners back from time to time, and the giraffe-hunting video is the latest attempt. It features English narrations and subtitles, something the first two videos in the series did not, and shows several white terrorists speaking in what sounds like a British accent. And in place of executions and sermons that pepper many of their videos are bucolic scenes of bonhomie and carefree pleasures.This is typical of the propaganda that terrorist groups tailor to Westerners. ISIS, the most successful terrorist organization in terms of recruiting foreign fighters, has published an English-language guidebook on life in its self-styled caliphate that rhapsodizes about the ice cream one can supposedly get there. An al Qaeda manual for recruiters emphasizes building friendships with targets and convincing them that the media unfairly vilifies Islamist terrorists.  YouTubeA still from Al Shabab\'s recruitment video, geared toward Western recruits.Al Shabab is working hard to rehabilitate its reputation with Muslims as part of its new tack. Over the last several years, the group has avoided civilian-focused attacks inside of Somalia in favor of government and military targets. In Kenya, a frequent al Shabab target, the group has also taken a softer approach toward Muslim communities, making a show of sparing Muslim lives during attacks as it tries to cast itself as a defense force against Christian aggression.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display("dfp-ad-x90_2");    });  Al Shabab\'s competition with ISIS for attention, funding, and fighters may lead it to send some of its members westward to sow terror.There are unfortunate trends within Somalia that increase the chances of success for al Shabab\'s charm offensive. A 2006 Ethiopian invasion of Somalia prompted a nationalist backlash that swelled al Shabab\'s ranks. Ethiopia demolished a coalition of sharia courts known as the Islamic Courts Union that had conquered swathes of southern Somalia, but ended up strengthening al Shabab as a result. Recruitment was not limited to Somalis, either: Westerners also joined in the invasion\'s wake, eager to fight Ethiopian "crusaders." Ethiopia has since retreated, but is now back in Somalia as part of the African Union Mission in Somalia. And although many Somalis welcome AMISOM\'s efforts, some of its troops have been accused of raping and murdering civilians, stirring the population\'s ire. The risk of a nationalist backlash against AMISOM grows daily, and is always good fodder for al Shabab recruitment.The danger of further Western recruitment is self-evident. It is rare for foreign fighters to return to their country of origin to continue the jihad, but the recent ISIS attack on Paris, which appears to have involved at least one terrorist returnee from Syria, could be a harbinger of things to come. If it is, al Shabab\'s competition with ISIS for attention, funding, and fighters may lead it to send some of its members westward to sow terror. Doing so would provide the group with a reputational boost in a crowded market.  Fortunately, al Shabab\'s attempts to win Westerners have been largely unsuccessful. Its continued unpopularity is part of the problem, but the rise of ISIS has contributed to the group\'s troubles as well. ISIS is now dominating Western recruitment efforts, even among Somali-Americans.This does not mean, however, that the United States can be complacent. The U.S. government has focused on building bridges with the Somali-American community ever since it began losing citizens to al Shabab recruitment campaigns, and later to ISIS. But every day that AMISOM remains in Somalia to prop up Mogadishu\'s sputtering central government, the risk that al Shabab can capitalize on nationalist resentment grows. ISIS may also have its own reputation problem brewing as unrest over its taxation and extortion practices mounts, which would make al Shabab\'s cultural, linguistic, and religious overtures more attractive for radicalized Somali-Americans.Al Shabab is fighting an uphill battle, but there are several trends working in its favor. The United States is focusing its efforts on fighting ISIS and ISIS recruitment, for example. This is a worthy goal, but Washington cannot afford to overlook the threat posed by al Shabab. It is canny, adaptable, and determined to again win Western recruits--this time with potentially far worse consequences for the West. '

S'Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has made it clear that he has no interest in negotiating with rebels, whom he considers "terrorists." His allies, Moscow and Tehran, also continue to rebuff demands for him to step down. So did it matter that, last week, members of the Syrian opposition repeated their calls for Assad\'s removal in a conference in Riyadh? It is hardly consequential in the near term. But the conference\'s goal--to put the Syrian opposition\'s house in order--is a worthy one. In fact, it is critical for international efforts to end the civil war.Riyadh, along with Ankara and Doha, is committed to toppling Assad. Yet what all three capitals have finally realized is that the Syrian leader\'s departure, whether by force or negotiation, cannot be achieved without a more coherent Syrian opposition that can speak with one voice in international fora and effectively join arms on the battlefield. Of course, unifying the huge mess that is the Syrian opposition is easier said than done. And it\'s not like it hasn\'t been tried before. Over the past four years, none of the attempts by various countries to unify the rebels and the politicians has worked. And so, Saudi Arabia will try to succeed where others before it have failed, even though its own record of bringing together rival Palestinian groups over the years has not been stellar.In a sense, Riyadh cannot afford to fail. A more integrated Syrian opposition is at the core of its diplomatic and military plans in Syria. If Russia and Iran continue to reject negotiations over Assad\'s fate, Saudi Arabia\'s response will be to work more closely with Turkey and Qatar and step up arms and money transfers to what they hope will be a more structured rebel apparatus. If Russia and Iran approve talks in January, the Saudi-Turkish-Qatari axis will want to rein in this new force and present it before the international community as a power that can negotiate with representatives of the regime.  Molhem Barakat / ReutersA fighter from the Tawhid Brigade, which operates under the Free Syrian Army, prepares homemade rockets to be thrown towards the 80th Brigade base in Aleppo, controlled by forces loyal to Syria\'s President Bashar al-Assad, November 11, 2013.Whether Russia and Iran will choose escalation or accommodation partly depends on the nature of this newly shaped Syrian opposition. To assuage international concerns over terrorist infiltration within the opposition, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Qatar have tasked Jordan with creating a "who\'s who" list of the Syrian rebels that would separate the "terrorists" from the "moderates." The easy part is identifying adherents to the Islamic State (also known as ISIS) and Jabhat Al Nusra, the Syrian branch of al Qaeda. The hard part is vetting the rest of the Syrian rebel groups, with Moscow and Tehran breathing down Amman\'s neck. Russia and Iran are closely monitoring the situation and are most concerned about the Saudi-sponsored JayshAlIslam, a collection of 12 rebel groups, and the Turkish- and Qatari-backed AhrarAlSham, an ultraconservative Islamist faction of more than 25,000 fighters with Syrian nationalist leanings.That both groups participated in last week\'s conference in Riyadh suggests that they will not be labeled as terrorist groups, despite Ahrar Al Sham\'s military entente and its sporadic coordination with Jabhat Al Nusra. The groups\' involvement in the conference drew the ire of Russia and Iran, but their objections could be tempered if Saudi Arabia and Turkey manage to extract concessions from their surrogates.  Asking Ahrar Al Sham to meaningfully compromise won\'t be easy because its negotiation ceiling is very high. Its maximalist demands include the establishment of Sharia law in any future Syrian state (which would undermine the secular nature of the state); the total dismantlement of the regime, including its security apparatus (which could lead to the collapse of order, similar to what happened in Iraq in 2003 after the undoing of the Iraqi state); and the rejection of any future government that is based on sectarian and ethnic quotas (even though Syrian society contains various sects and ethnicities, all of whom should be represented in any new political system).Students play during their break inside Hosam Kamel school in the rebel-controlled area of Maaret al-Numan town in Idlib province, Syria October 28, 2015.Despite these problematic demands, Ahrar Al Sham did sign off on the final communique that came out of the Riyadh conference, which clearly calls for an all-inclusive, civic state. It\'s possible, of course, that the group plans to change its mind if and when the transition takes place and then impose its dogmatic preferences. But that is a risk probably worth taking because the alternative--the exclusion of one of the most powerful Syrian rebels groups--would be costly if it leads to Ahrar Al Sham effectively partnering with Jabhat Al Nusra. It is also possible that if the group assumes a political role that is commensurate with its size and power in a future Syrian state, the burden of governance might temper its mindset and make it more accepting of notions of political tolerance and pluralism. That\'s a long shot, though, given its Salafi jihadi ideology.What helps considerably is that Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Qatar have leverage over their proxies--they can stop sending them weapons and money and helping them with intelligence and logistics. However, for these countries to exercise this leverage, Russia and Iran have to give something in return, and it starts with agreeing to a political transition that leads to Assad departing the political scene. There\'s no way around it; no party in Syria will be able to achieve its objectives at the expense of its adversaries or without incurring enormous costs. It\'s good that all regional powers agree that there is no military solution to the Syrian conflict. But this consensus is not enough. They now have to find a way to compromise to attain a political solution. This is where the real diplomacy resides. '

S'In recent weeks, several leading Republican presidential candidates have argued in favor of selectively sealing U.S. borders to Syrians and others. That--and the discontinuation of any Syrian refugee resettlement programs--they argue, will keep the United States safe from terrorist attacks. Such fantastical and ill-informed suggestions are counterproductive on their own terms, but they also distract from very real and consequential ways in which refugees and migrants are being used as political and military weapons.PEOPLE PUSHERSAll sides in the Syrian civil war have, to some extent, strategically engineered mass movements of civilians into and away from their areas of territorial control. In some cases, the systemic depopulation and repopulation of territory represent attempts to gain tactical military advantage. For example, in early October Amnesty International reported that the Democratic Union Party (PYD), a Kurdish rebel group in Syria, was demolishing homes and displacing entire villages in order to, as Mao would have put it, "drain the sea [the civilians] in which the fish [the enemy] swims." The PYD is not alone. This kind of engineered migration has long been a tool of warfare, since noncombatants can provide safety, succor, and support and serve as a source of recruits.Conversely, civilians may also be prohibited from fleeing areas controlled by combatants, in order to shield soldiers and their supporters from military attack. Human Rights Watch reported in early November, for instance, that the rebel group Jaysh al-Islam has been keeping civilian hostages in northern Syria in order to deter attacks by government forces.  Brendan McDermid / ReutersPeople take part in an anti-Donald Trump, pro-immigration protest outside the Plaza Hotel, where U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump spoke, in the Manhattan borough of New York December 11, 2015. Trump vowed to close the borders to Muslims.In other cases, such demographic reengineering schemes appear to be longer-term bids to maintain or secure postwar control of particular pieces of Syrian real estate, through a strategy I have called "dispossessive engineered migration," a subset of which is ethnic cleansing. It has been reported, for instance, that forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad have been selectively cleansing neighborhoods under their control and repopulating them with regime allies, some of whom are internally displaced people from elsewhere in Syria. Likewise, as War on the Rocks reported last week, the self-proclaimed Islamic State (also known as ISIS) has routinely used violence to encourage "infidels" to flee their lands and then offered their property and assets to incoming loyalists. This strategy of seizure and appropriation through forced migration, too, has a long and rather sordid history.But the weaponization of displaced people is not limited to conflict zones; migrants and refugees may also be used for influence far from the battlefield. For instance, during the first week of November, Jamal Zubia, spokesman for the National Salvation Government of Libya\'s General National Congress--one of the two rival governments in Libya--issued a lightly veiled threat against the European Union: if not offered diplomatic recognition and financial assistance, it might actively assist migrants and asylum seekers in their bids to reach Europe. In an interview with The Telegraph, Zubia emphasized that although his Tripoli-based faction was not planning to follow through on its threat imminently, it might well do so in future: "We are protecting the gates of Europe, yet Europe does not recognize us and does not want to recognize us. So why should we stop the migrants here? . . . It is a strategic threat, yes, but I would not rule out us doing it one day."The Libyan warning came close on the heels of analogous threats that Turkey reportedly made in September and October (and possibly earlier). According to The Wall Street Journal, Reuters, and other sources, Turkish demands on Europe included financial aid to mitigate the significant burden of hosting more than two million Syrians, the lifting of EU-related visa restrictions on Turkish travelers, and the reinvigoration of Turkey\'s EU membership bid. By some accounts, Ankara also renewed an earlier demand for the creation of a "safe zone" along the Syrian border.In both the Libyan and Turkish cases, the underlying message was clear: concede to our demands or face (possibly severe) migration-related consequences. Although the Libyan threat apparently remains latent for the moment, a number of Turkish demands have already been met, including an initial three billion euros in aid and the resuscitation of Ankara\'s EU membership bid, according to The New York Times, the BBC, and other sources.Using migration as an instrument of state-level coercion is nothing new. Since the 1951 Refugee Convention came into force, there have been at least 75 attempts by state and nonstate actors to use displaced people as means to political, military, and economic ends. Coercers\' demands have ranged from the simple provision of financial aid to requests for full-scale invasion and assistance in effecting regime change. Such was the case when the exiled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide used the threat of a flood of Haitian boat people into the United States to persuade the administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton to oust the sitting junta and restore him to power in September 1994.Likewise, former Libyan leader Muammar al-Qaddafi rather dramatically promised to "turn Europe black" if the EU failed to meet his demands. Although his objectives varied widely over time--and ranged from the lifting of sanctions to the provision of billions of euros in aid to the quashing of support for protesters in the early days of what became the Libyan uprising--Qaddafi used this tool with varying degrees of success in 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2010, before fatally overplaying his hand in 2011.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display("dfp-ad-x90_2");    });  In nearly three-quarters of the historical cases, the coercers achieved at least some of their objectives. In well over half of the documented cases, they obtained all or nearly all of what they sought, which makes this tactic more effective, albeit harder to successfully manage and control, than either economic sanctions or traditional, military-backed coercive diplomacy.Even more striking, some threats to deploy refugees and migrants as weapons have actually been carried out. In the spring of 1999, then Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic initially threatened and later expelled hundreds of thousands of Kosovars in an attempt first to deter NATO from launching a bombing campaign during the Kosovo war and then to compel the alliance into ceasing it. Former German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer later admitted his regret in not taking Milosevic seriously when he said that he "could empty Kosovo in a week."Former Cuban President Fidel Castro also used migration as a weapon against the United States on at least three occasions: in 1965, in 1994, and, most famously, during the Mariel boatlift of 1980. As with Qaddafi, Castro\'s objectives and demands varied over time but included, among other things, a significant shift in US policy toward Cuban hijackers and the regularization of U.S.-Cuban immigration.FIGHTING BACKDespite its prevalence, this kind of coercion has historically been underreported. For one thing, coercive threats are often issued privately and bilaterally; in many cases, neither coercers nor their targets have incentives to reveal the political blackmail. For another, this kind of coercion is sometimes intertwined with other political considerations. For example, Ugandan leader Idi Amin expelled most Asians from his country in 1972, in what has commonly been interpreted as a naked asset grab, since Asians owned most of the big businesses in Uganda during that period. Far less noted is the fact that approximately 50,000 of those who were pushed out held British passports and that these expulsions happened at the same time Amin was demanding that the British halt a planned drawdown of military assistance to his country. Amin even announced his intention to foist 50,000 refugees on the British, with a convenient 90-day grace period for the country to reconsider its decision on military aid.As in the Ugandan case, the vast majority of known targets of this kind of coercion have been liberal democracies (over 70 percent); another 11 percent have been groups of countries that have included liberal democracies. This is no accident. Liberal democracies tend to be particularly vulnerable because they find themselves trapped between conflicting imperatives. On the one hand, such states generally have made normative and legal commitments to protect those fleeing violence and persecution. On the other, as recent events in Europe and the United States make clear, some segments of democratic polities are strenuously opposed to accepting displaced people, whether for rational economic, political, or cultural reasons or for irrational, xenophobic ones. Because targets cannot simultaneously embrace a given group of migrants and reject them, the incentives to concede to coercers\' demands and make the problem disappear can be compelling.  So what options do potential targets of migration-driven coercion have? There are several, but none is a silver bullet; each has advantages and drawbacks. Targets can concede, but this carries the risk that coercers may repeat and escalate their demands, as Qaddafi did in the 2000s. Alternatively, targets can take military action to change conditions on the ground in countries of origin. But wars are costly and their outcomes uncertain. Again, the Qaddafi example is instructive: the threat of Libyan coercion did not disappear when he did, and subsequent instability in the country and the region does not inspire confidence about the option of regime change.Alternatively, target governments can appeal to their populations to welcome the displaced, emphasizing the long-term economic virtues of migration, particularly for countries suffering declining birthrates and shrinking tax bases. If this strategy succeeds, coercion becomes impossible because threats of "flooding" will, in theory, be met with a shrug. But this kind of attitude change tends to be the result of a long-term campaign. The strategy is generally not effective in the midst of an ongoing migration emergency. And it would be particularly challenging in the wake of the attacks in Paris, in light of the fact that at least one of the ISIS-aligned attackers traveled to Europe in the midst of a stream of displaced people.Finally, and conversely, targeted states can abrogate their commitments, close their borders, and lock their doors. This, too, makes successful migration-driven coercion difficult, if not impossible. However, such a stance often encourages others to follow suit and would represent an abandonment of key components of liberal democracies\' most enviable values. In the end, the long-term costs to liberal morals, philosophy, and identity may be far greater than any short-term humanitarian- and assimilation-related costs that come from accepting migrants and refugees, the real victims of this kind of coercion. Such an approach is also very unlikely to solve migration-related security concerns. Indeed, sealing the borders to migrants and refugees may ironically help feed jihadist narratives, which in turn may sow the seeds for a different kind of weaponization of the displaced. '
